### Exchange Server Mailbox Backup and Restore Account

Procedure:

1. Create a new mailbox as the backup and restore account. After creation, the mailbox will become a new account in the domain automatically. Tips:

   **Exchange 2010**: Log in to the Exchange host, open the Exchange management console, expand the **Recipient Configuration**, right-click **Mailbox**, and select **New Mailbox...**. Create a new Exchange mailbox according to the prompts and set a username such as xxxxBackupUser.

   **Exchange 2013**: Log in to the Exchange Web Admin Center. On the **recipients** page, click **+** and select **User mailbox**. Create a new Exchange mailbox according to the prompts and set a username such as xxxxBackupUser.

2. To log in to Exchange on the ADPS console, the account must be a member of Domain Admins. On the domain controller, open **Active Directory Users and Computers**, double-click the new account, select **Member of**, and click **Add** to add this user to Domain Admins. Click **OK**.

3. To add Exchange credentials in the host properties, create a new role group and add the new account to the group. Open Exchange Management Shell and do the following:

   **Create a role group**: Create a role group named xxxxBackupRoles:

   ```
   New-RoleGroup -Name xxxxBackupRoles -Roles @("Database Copies", "Databases", "Exchange Servers", "Monitoring", "Mail Recipient Creation", "Mail Recipients", "Recipient Policies", "View-Only Configuration")
   ```

   **Parameters**:

   - **Database Copies**: enables administrators to manage the database copies on individual servers.

   - **Databases**: enables administrators to create, manage, mount, and dismount mailbox databases on individual servers.

   - **Exchange Servers**: enables administrators to manage the Exchange server configuration on individual servers.

   - **Monitoring**: enables administrators to monitor Exchange services and component availability in an organization. In addition to administrators, roles associated with this role type can be used with service accounts used by monitoring applications to gather information about the state of servers running Exchange.

   - **Mail Recipient Creation**: enables administrators to create mailboxes, mail users, mail contacts, distribution groups, and dynamic distribution groups.

   - **Mail Recipients**: enables administrators to manage existing mailboxes, mail users, mail contacts, distribution groups, and dynamic distribution groups.

   - **Recipient Policies**: enables administrators to manage recipient policies in an organization, such as configuration policies.

   - **View-Only Configuration**: enables administrators to view all non-recipients in an organization.

   **Add a role group member**: Add xxxxBackupUser into the xxxxBackupUser role group:

   ```
   Add-RoleGroupMember -Identity xxxxBackupRoles -Member xxxxBackupUser
   ```

4. On the Exchange Management Shell, do the following:

   **Create management roles**: Based on the parent role ApplicationImpersonation, create a management role named xxxEWSImpersonationRole

   ```
   New-ManagementRole -Name xxxxEWSImpersonationRole -Parent ApplicationImpersonation
   ```

   **Parameters**:

   - **ApplicationImpersonation**: enables applications to impersonate users in an organization to perform tasks on behalf of the user.

   **Assign management roles**: Assign xxxEWSImpersonationRole to xxxBackupUser

   ```
   New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Role xxxxEWSImpersonationRole - User xxxxBackupUser -Name "xxxxBackupUser-EWSImpersonation"
   ```

   **Create a new throttling policy for Exchange 2010**: Create an unlimited EWS throttling policy

   ```
   New-ThrottlingPolicy -Name "xxxxEWSThrottlingPolicy" - EWSPercentTimeInCAS $null -EWSPercentTimeInAD $null - EWSMaxConcurrency $null -EWSPercentTimeInMailboxRPC $null - PowerShellMaxConcurrency $null
   ```

   **Parameters**:

   - **EWSPercentTimeInCAS**: defines the percentage of one minute that an Exchange Web Services user can spend executing CAS code. The value of 100 means that for every one-minute window, the user can spend 60 seconds consuming the related resource.

   - **EWSPercentTimeInAD**: defines the percentage of one minute that an Exchange Web Services user can spend executing LDAP requests. The value of 100 means that for every one-minute window, the user can spend 60 seconds consuming the related resource.

   - **EWSMaxConcurrency**: defines the number of concurrent connections that an Exchange Web Services user can establish with an Exchange server at one time. A connection is maintained from the moment the request is received until a complete response is sent to the requestor. If the user tries to make more concurrent requests than the policy allows, the new connection attempt will fail. However, the existing connections are still valid. The parameter ranges from 0 to 2147483647 inclusive. The default value is 10. To indicate that the number of concurrent connections has no limit, the value should be set to $null.

   - **EWSPercentTimeInMailboxRPC**: defines the percentage of one minute that an Exchange Web Services user can spend executing mailbox RPC requests. The value of 100 means that for every one-minute window, the user can spend 60 seconds consuming the related resource.

   - **PowerShellMaxConcurrency**: defines the maximum number of remote PowerShell sessions that a remote PowerShell user can open at the same time.

   **Create a new throttling policy for Exchange 2013 and later**: Create an unlimited EWS throttling policy

   ```
   New-ThrottlingPolicy -Name "xxxxEWSThrottlingPolicy" - EwsCutoffBalance "Unlimited" -EwsMaxBurst "Unlimited" - EwsMaxConcurrency "Unlimited" -ExchangeMaxCmdlets "Unlimited" -MessageRateLimit "Unlimited" -PowerShellCutoffBalance "Unlimited" -PowerShellMaxBurst "Unlimited" - PowerShellMaxCmdlets "Unlimited" -PowerShellMaxConcurrency "Unlimited" -PowerShellMaxOperations "Unlimited" - RecipientRateLimit "Unlimited" -ThrottlingPolicyScope "Regular"
   ```

   **Parameters**:

   - **EwsCutoffBalance**: defines the resource consumption limits for an EWS user before the user is completely blocked from performing operations on a specific component.

   - **EwsMaxBurst**: defines the amount of time that an EWS user can consume a large amount of resources before being throttled.

   - **EwsMaxConcurrency**: applies to all actions except streaming notifications.

   - **ExchangeMaxCmdlets**: defines the number of cmdlets that can be executed in a specific time period before their execution is slowed down.

   - **MessageRateLimit**: defines the number of messages in one minute that can be submitted to transport by POP3 or IMAP4 clients that use SMTP.

   - **PowerShellCutoï¬€Balance**: defines the resource consumption limits for a user before the user is completely blocked from performing operations on a specific component.

   - **PowerShellMaxBurst**: defines the amount of time that a user can consume an elevated amount of resources before being throttled.

   - **PowerShellMaxCmdlets**: defines the number of cmdlets that can be executed in a specific time period before their execution is stopped.

   - **PowerShellMaxConcurrency**: defines the number of concurrent cmdlet executions that a user can have at the same time.

   - **PowerShellMaxOperations**: specifies the protocol-level operations that are used to send and receive data.

   - **RecipientRateLimit**: defines the limits on the number of recipients that a user can address in 24 hours.

   - **ThrottlingPolicyScope**: defines the scope of the throttling policy.

   **Set the mailbox policy**: Assign xxxxEWSThrottlingPolicy to xxxxBackupUser

   ```
   Set-Mailbox -Identity xxxxBackupUser -ThrottlingPolicy "xxxxEWSThrottlingPolicy"
   ```

5. Open the Exchange Management Console, expand **Recipient Configuration**, click **Mailboxes**, and select the mailbox that you want to back up. Right-click the mailbox and **select Manage Full Access Permission**. Add xxxxBackupUser that you create in the first step. Click **OK**. This operation is required for MAPI backup but not for EWS backup.

6. Enable the Basic Identity Authentication on the CAS node for EWS mailbox backup: IIS -> Default Web Site -> EWS -> Identity Authentication -> Enable Basic Identity Authentication.

### Check Resource

Log in to the ADPS console as an operator. Go to **Resource**. The activated and authorized resource is available on the host list with an Online state. If the resource is not available, see *Activate License and Authorize User*.

![login-1.png](../images/exchange/03-exchange/login-1.png)

### Check Storage Pool

Log in to the ADPS console as an operator. Go to the **Storage Pool** page and verify that a storage pool is available. If no storage pool is available, contact the admin to create one and assign permissions to the operator.

![storaged-1.png](../images/exchange/03-exchange/storaged-1.png)

## First Time Login

1. Exchange 2013 MAPI authentication can be set to Basic or NTLM. NTLM authentication is used by default. However, when the Exchange server is limited by local security policies and group policies, NTLM authentication may not work. In this case, you can modify the authentication to Basic.

2. Before the first Exchange backup and restore, go to **Resource** and click **Login** beside the resource to log in to Exchange.

   ![login-2.png](../images/exchange/03-exchange/login-2.png)

## Backup Protection Strategy

###  Backup Schedule Operation

ADPS provides six types of backup schedules.

![time-1.png](../images/exchange/03-exchange/time-1.png)

- Immediate: The job immediately starts to run after it is submitted.
- One Time: After the job is created, it will be in an idle state and start to run when the specified Start time is reached.
- Hourly: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of hours/minutes within the time range according to the setting. The value ranges from 1 to 24 hours or 1 to 60 minutes.
- Daily: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of days according to the setting. The value is an integer between 1 and 5.
- Weekly: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of weeks according to the setting. You can specify which day of the week to run the job.
- Monthly: The job runs on the specified days of some months at the specified time. For example, you can set the job to run on January 1 and June 1 at 20:00. Or you can set it to run on the first Monday of every month at 20:00.

**Example: Run the job every two weeks on Friday at 18:00**

![time-3.png](../images/exchange/03-exchange/time-3.png)

**The execution time will be:**

- If the current time is Friday at 17:00, the execution time will be Friday at 18:00 (the current day).
- If the current time is Thursday at 17:00, the execution time will be Friday at 18:00 (the next day).
- If the current time is Saturday at 17:00, the execution time will be next Friday at 18:00.
- After the first run is completed, the job will start automatically at 18:00 on Friday every two weeks.

### Backup Strategy Advice

Exchange backup types include VSS-full backup, VSS-incremental backup, streaming-full backup, streaming-incremental backup, EWS mailbox backup, and MAPI mailbox backup. It is recommended to formulate the following backup strategy according to different situations such as network bandwidth, business data volume, security requirements, and the amount of data loss that you can tolerate.

1. Run a **Full Backup** once a week when the application traffic is small to ensure that you have an RTO of one week.

2. After that, you can run an **Incremental Backup** every day to reduce the backup time and ensure that you have an RPO of one day.

3. If the database supports log backup, you can run a **Log Backup** hourly to ensure that the RPO can reach the second level. For example, you can run a log backup every 2 hours.

4. Perform a **Mailbox Backup** once a week when mail growth is small.

> Avoid using the following strategies:
>
> - Only perform full backups.
> - Perform a full backup followed by all incremental or log backups.
