## Planning and preparation

Before you install the agent, check the following prerequisites:

1. You have already installed and configured other backup components, including the backup server and the storage server.
2. You have created a user with roles of operator and administrator on the ADPS console. Log in to the console with this user to back up and restore the resource.

```{note}
The administrator role can install and configure agents, activate licenses, and authorize users. The operator role can create backup/restore jobs and conduct copy data management (CDM).
```

## Install and configure the agent

To back up and restore SharePoint, first install the ADPS agent on the host where SharePoint resides.

### Verify the compatibility

Before you install the agent, ensure that the environment of the host where SharePoint resides is on the Aurreum Data Protection Suite's compatibility lists.

Supported SharePoint versions include:

- SharePoint 2007/2010/2013/2019

### Install the agent

The ADPS agent can be installed on Windows.

#### Windows

To install the agent, do the following:

1. Log in to the ADPS console.
2. From the menu, click **Resource** > **Resource**. The **Resource** page appears.
3. From the toolbar, click the **Install agent** icon. The **Install agent** window appears.
4. In the **Install agent** window, do the following:

	(1) From the **Select system** list, select **Windows**.

	(2) From the **Select file** list, select the package that you want to install.

	(3) Click **Download**.

5. Upload the package to the Windows host.
6. Log in to the Windows host as a user with administrative privileges. Double-click the package and open the installation wizard. Click **Next**.
7. At the **Select components** step, select **Microsoft SharePoint** from the component list. Click **Next**.
8. At the **Configure Aurreum Data Protection Suite agent** step, enter the following:

	(1) In the **Backup server address** field, enter the IP or domain name of the backup server.

	(2) In the **Backup server port** field, enter the port number. The default value is 50305. If you enable the **Use SSL secure connection** option, enter 60305 in the **Backup server port** field.

	(3) The **Access key** field is optional and blank by default. If your backup server adopts multi-tenancy, you must enter the access key of the tenant for the agent.

	(4) Click **Next**.

	```{note}
	To get the access key of the user/tenant:
	1. Log in to the ADPS console.
	2. On the upper right corner, click your avatar, and go to **Personal settings** > **Account settings**.
	3. On the **Preference** tab, click **View** to get the access key of the current user/tenant.
	```

9. Confirm the **Destination folder** or specify another folder. Click **Next**.
10. Wait for the installation to complete.

## Activate licenses and authorize users

After the agent installation, go back to the **Resource** page. The host with the agent installed appears on the page. Before you back up and restore SharePoint, register the host, activate the backup license, and authorize users.

To activate licenses and authorize users, do the following:

1. From the menu, click **Resource** > **Resource**. The **Resource** page appears.
2. On the **Resource** page, select the host where SharePoint resides. Click the **Register** icon. After the registration, the **Activate** window appears.

3. In the **Activate** window, select the SharePoint backup license, and click **Submit**. After the activation, the **Authorize** window appears.

	```{note}
	If you are prompted with "No enough licenses", contact the administrator to add licenses.
	```

4. In the **Authorize** window, select user groups to authorize access to the resource. Click **Submit**.

	```

```{note}
With many agents, install them first, then **batch register**, **batch activate**, and **batch authorize** the agents and resources for convenience. For details, see [Batch register/Batch activate/Batch authorize](../manager/manager.md#batch-registerbatch-activatebatch-authorize) in Aurreum Data Protection Suite Administrator's Guide.
```

## Backup

### Backup types

ADPS provides the full backup type for SharePoint.

- Full backup

  Backs up all the data of one or more site collections.

### Backup policies

ADPS provides six backup schedule types: immediate, one-time, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly.

- Immediate: ADPS will immediately start the job after it is created.
- One-time: ADPS will perform the job at the specified time once only.
- Hourly: ADPS will perform the job periodically at the specified hour/minute intervals within the time range according to the setting.
- Daily: ADPS will perform the job periodically at the specified time and day intervals.
- Weekly: ADPS will perform the job periodically at the specified time and week intervals.
- Monthly: ADPS will perform the job periodically at the specified dates and times.

You can set an appropriate backup policy based on your situation and requirements. Usually, we recommend the following common backup policy:

1. Perform a **full backup** once a week when the application traffic is relatively small (Example: on the weekend) to ensure that you have a recoverable point in time every week.

### Before you begin

Before you back up and restore SharePoint, check the following:

1. Check the SharePoint instance status.

2. Check storage pools.

	(1) From the menu, click **Storage** > **Storage pool**. The **Storage pool** page appears.

	(2) Check whether the display area has any storage pools. If no, create a storage pool and authorize it for the current user. For details, see [Add a storage pool](../manager/manager.md#add-a-storage-pool) in Aurreum Data Protection Suite Administrator's Guide.


### Log in to the instance

To log in to the resource, do the following:

1. From the menu, click **Resource** > **Resource**. The **Resource** page appears.

2. From the host list, find the host where SharePoint resides. If you have many hosts, use the search bar to find the host quickly. Click the host to expand its resource list.

3. Click **Login** beside the resource. The **Login** window appears.

	```{only} scutech

```

## Restore

### Restore types

ADPS provides the point-in-time restore for SharePoint.

- Point-in-time restore

  When a disaster occurs in a SharePoint site collection, you can perform a point-in-time restore job to restore the site collection to a specified point-in-time state. You can restore to the original or a different host.

```{note}
To restore to a different host, same operating systems and same SharePoint versions are required.
```

### Before you begin

To restore SharePoint to a different host, install the agent on that host, activate the licenses, and authorize user access to the resource.

```{note}
1. Use Windows administrator user to log in to the SharePoint resource on the console. If you use the other Windows SYSTEM user to log in, the restore will fail due to no restore permission.
2. To restore to a differnt host, create an identical web application on the target host as the one on the source host.
```
