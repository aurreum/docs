# User Guide for Microsoft Exchange Server

## Overview

This guide introduces how to install and configure the ADPS agent, and how to properly use ADPS to back up and restore Exchange Server.

The backup and restore features supported by ADPS include:

- Backup sources

	Single or multiple databases and mailboxes

- Backup types

	Snapshot (VSS) backup (full backup and incremental backup), streaming backup (full backup and log backup), and mailbox backup (EWS mailbox backup and MAPI mailbox backup)

- Backup targets

	Standard storage pool, deduplication storage pool, local storage pool, tape library pool, object storage service pool, and LAN-free pool

- Backup schedules

	Immediate, one-time, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly

- Data processing

	Data compression, multiple channels, reconnection, and speed limit

- Restore types

	Point-in-time restore, EWS mailbox recovery

- Restore targets

	Original host, different host (same version required)

## Planning and preparation

Before you install the agent, check the following prerequisites:

1. You have already installed and configured other backup components, including the backup server and the storage server.
2. You have created a user with roles of operator and administrator on the ADPS console. Log in to the console with this user to back up and restore the resource.

```{note}
The administrator role can install and configure agents, activate licenses, and authorize users. The operator role can create backup/restore jobs and conduct copy data management (CDM).
```

## Install and configure the agent

To back up and restore Exchange Server, first install the ADPS agent on the host where Exchange Server resides.

### Verify the compatibility

ADPS supports the backup and restore of Exchange Server in standalone mode and Exchange Server Database Availability Group (DAG). Before you install the agent, ensure that the environment of the host where Exchange Server resides is on the Aurreum Data Protection Suite's compatibility lists.

ADPS supports the backup and restore of Exchange Server, including:

- Exchange Server 2000/2003/2007/2010/2013/2016/2019

### Install the agent

ADPS agent can be installed on Windows.

To install the agent, do the following:

1. Log in to the ADPS console.
2. From the menu, click **Resource** > **Resource**. The **Resource** page appears.
3. From the toolbar, click the **Install agent** icon. The **Install agent** window appears.
4. In the **Install agent** window, do the following:

	(1) From the **Select system** list, select **Windows**.

	(2) From the **Select file** list, select the package that you want to install.

	(3) Click **Download**.

5. Upload the package to the Windows host.
6. Log in to the Windows host as a user with administrative privileges. Double-click the package and open the installation wizard. Click **Next**.
7. At the **Select components** step, select **Microsoft Exchange Server** from the component list. Click **Next**.
8. At the **Configure Aurreum Data Protection Suite agent** step, enter the following:

	```{only} scutech
	![](../images/Common/exchange/exchange_agent01.png)
	```

	(1) In the **Backup server address** field, enter the IP or domain name of the backup server.
	
	(2) In the **Backup server port** field, enter the port number. The default value is 50305. If you enable the **Use SSL secure connection** option, enter 60305 in the **Backup server port** field.
	
	(3) The **Access key** field is optional and blank by default. If your backup server adopts multi-tenancy, you must enter the access key of the tenant for the agent.
	
	(4) Click **Next**.
	
	```{note}
	To get the access key of the user/tenant:
	1. Log in to the ADPS console.
	2. On the upper right corner, click your avatar, and go to **Personal settings** > **Account settings**.
	3. On the **Preference** tab, click **View** to get the access key of the current user/tenant.
	```

9. Confirm the **Destination folder** or specify another folder. Click **Next**.
10. Wait for the installation to complete.

## Activate licenses and authorize users

After the agent installation, go back to the **Resource** page. The host with the agent installed appears on the page. Before you back up and restore Exchange Server, register the host, activate the backup license, and authorize users.

To activate licenses and authorize users, do the following:

1. From the menu, click **Resource** > **Resource**. The **Resource** page appears.

2. On the **Resource** page, select the host where Exchange Server resides. Click the **Register** icon. Then the **Activate** window appears.

3. In the **Activate** window, select the Exchange Server backup license, and click **Submit**. After the activation, the **Authorize** window appears.

	```{note}
	If you are prompted with "No enough licenses", contact the administrator to add licenses.
	```

4. In the **Authorize** window, select user groups to authorize access to the resource. Click **Submit**.

```{only} scutech
![](../images/Common/exchange/exchange_license01.png)
```

```{note}
With many agents, install them first, then **batch register**, **batch activate**, and **batch authorize** the agents and resources for convenience. For details, see [Batch register/Batch activate/Batch authorize](../manager/manager.md#batch-registerbatch-activatebatch-authorize) in Aurreum Data Protection Suite Administrator's Guide.
```

## Backup 

### Backup types

ADPS provides four backup types for Exchange Server: full backup, incremental backup, log backup, and mailbox backup (EWS mailbox backup, MAPI mailbox backup).

- Full backup

	Backs up all data in one or multiple databases.

- Incremental backup

	Backs up only the data that has changed since the last backup with a full backup or incremental backup as the baseline.

- Log backup

	Backs up transaction logs with a full backup as the baseline. It is possible to specify a point in time when transaction logs are used for restore. Compared to full backups, backing up transaction logs is more efficient in terms of time and space. In addition, the transaction logs are truncated to prevent log files from getting huge.

- Mailbox backup (EWS mailbox backup and MAPI mailbox backup).

	EWS mailbox backup only backs up the folders visible in Outlook Top of Information Store, while MAPI mailbox backup can back up the entire mailbox directory.

### Backup policies

ADPS provides six backup schedule types: immediate, one-time, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly.

- Immediate: ADPS will immediately start the job after it is created.
- One-time: ADPS will perform the job at the specified time once only.
- Hourly: ADPS will perform the job periodically at the specified hour/minute intervals within the time range according to the setting.
- Daily: ADPS will perform the job periodically at the specified time and day intervals.
- Weekly: ADPS will perform the job periodically at the specified time and week intervals.
- Monthly: ADPS will perform the job periodically at the specified dates and times.

You can set an appropriate backup policy based on your situation and requirements. Usually, we recommend the following common backup policy:

1. Snapshot (VSS) backup (full backup): Perform a **full backup** once a week when the application traffic is relatively small (Example: on the weekend) to ensure that you have a recoverable point in time every week.
2. Snapshot (VSS) backup (incremental backup): Perform an **incremental backup** every day when the application traffic is relatively small (Example: at 2 a.m.) to ensure that you have a recoverable point in time every day, which can save storage space and backup time.
3. Streaming backup (full backup): Perform a **full backup** once a week if your database supports streaming backup when the application traffic is relatively small (Example: on the weekend) to ensure that you have a recoverable point in time every week.
4. Streaming backup (log backup): Perform a **log backup** hourly if your database supports log backup to ensure that you have a second-level point in time available everyday.
5. Mailbox backup: Perform a **mailbox backup** every day when the application traffic is relatively small (Example: at 2 a.m.) to ensure that you have a recoverable point in time every day, which can save storage space and backup time.

### Exchange versions for backup types

Please refer to the following table for the available backup types corresponding to different Exchange versions:

```{tabularcolumns} |\Y{0.20}|\Y{0.80}|
```
```{table} Exchange versions for backup types
---
class: longtable
---
|Backup type |Exchange versions|
| --- | --- |
|VSS backup|Available for Exchange Server 2003 and above.{{ br }} Snapshot (VSS) incremental backup is not available for Exchange Server 2003.|

|EWS mailbox backup|Available for Exchange Server 2010 and above.|
```
### Exchange Server backup and restore account

To configure a backup and restore account of Exchange Server, do the following:

1. Create a new mailbox as the backup and restore account. After creation, the mailbox will automatically become a new account in the domain. 

  - For Exchange Server 2010:

	(1) Log in to the host where the Exchange Server resides, open the Exchange Server management console, expand the **Recipient Configuration**, right-click **Mailbox**, and select **New Mailboxâ€¦**. 

	(2) Create a new Exchange mailbox according to the prompts and set a username such as xxxxBackupUser.

  - For Exchange Server 2013 and above versions:

	(1) Log in to the Exchange Web Admin Center. On the **Recipients** page, click **+** and select **User mailbox**

	(2) Create a new Exchange mailbox according to the prompts and set a username such as xxxxBackupUser.

2. To log in to Exchange Server on the ADPS console, the account must be a member of Domain Admins. On the domain controller, open **Active Directory Users and Computers**, double-click the new account, select **Member of**, and click **Add** to add this user to Domain Admins. Click **OK**.

3. To add Exchange Server credentials in the host properties, create a new role group and add the new account to the group. Open Exchange Management Shell and do the following:

	(1) Create a role group: Create a role group named xxxxBackupRoles.

	```{code-block} shell
	New-RoleGroup -Name xxxBackupRoles -Roles @ï¼ˆ"Database Copies"ï¼Œ"Databases"ï¼Œ"Exchange Servers"ï¼Œ"Monitoring"ï¼Œ"Mail Recipient Creation"ï¼Œ"Mail Recipients"ï¼Œ"Recipient Policies"ï¼Œ"View-Only Configuration"ï¼‰
	```

	(2) Add a role group member: Add xxxxBackupUser into the xxxxBackupUser role group.
	
	```{code-block} shell
	Add-RoleGroupMember -Identity xxxBackupRoles -Member xxxBackupUser
	```

4. To back up EWS mailboxes, do the following on the Exchange Management Shell:

	(1) Create management roles: Based on the parent role ApplicationImpersonation, create a management role named xxxEWSImpersonationRole.

	```{code-block} shell
	New-ManagementRole -Name xxxEWSImpersonationRole -Parent ApplicationImpersonation
	```

	(2) Assign management roles: Assign xxxEWSImpersonationRole to xxxBackupUser.

	```{code-block} shell
	New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Role xxxEWSImpersonationRole -User xxxBackupUser -Name "xxxBackupUser-EWSImpersonation"
	```

	(3) Create a new throttling policy for Exchange 2010: Create an unlimited EWS throttling policy.

	```{code-block} shell
	New-ThrottlingPolicy -Name "xxxEWSThrottlingPolicy" -EWSPercentTimeInCAS $null -EWSPercentTimeInAD $null -EWSMaxConcurrency $null -EWSPercentTimeInMailboxRPC $null -PowerShellMaxConcurrency $null
	```

	(4) Create a new throttling policy for Exchange 2013 and later: Create an unlimited EWS throttling policy

	```{code-block} shell
	New-ThrottlingPolicy -Name "xxxEWSThrottlingPolicy" -EwsCutoffBalance "Unlimited" -EwsMaxBurst "Unlimited" -EwsMaxConcurrency "Unlimited" -ExchangeMaxCmdlets "Unlimited" -MessageRateLimit "Unlimited" -PowerShellCutoffBalance "Unlimited" -PowerShellMaxBurst "Unlimited" -PowerShellMaxCmdlets "Unlimited" -PowerShellMaxConcurrency "Unlimited" -PowerShellMaxOperations "Unlimited" -RecipientRateLimit "Unlimited" -ThrottlingPolicyScope "Regular"
	```

	(5) Set the mailbox policy: Assign xxxxEWSThrottlingPolicy to xxxxBackupUser

	```{code-block} shell
	Set-Mailbox -Identity xxxBackupUser -ThrottlingPolicy "xxxEWSThrottlingPolicy"
	```
   
5. Enable the Basic Identity Authentication for EWS mailbox backup: IIS -> Default Web Site -> EWS -> Identity Authentication -> Enable Basic Identity Authentication.

6. Open the Exchange Management Console, expand **Recipient Configuration**, click **Mailboxes**, and select the mailbox that you want to back up. Right-click the mailbox and **select Manage Full Access Permission**. Add xxxxBackupUser that you create in the first step. Click **OK**. This operation is required for MAPI mailbox backup but not for EWS mailbox backup.

### Before you begin

Before you back up and restore Exchange Server, check the following:

1. Check the Exchange Server instance status

	(1) Run Windows PowerShell as administrator on Windows.

	(2) Enter the following command in Windows PowerShell windows.
