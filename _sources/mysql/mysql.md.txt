![license-4](../image/mysql/02-license/license-4.png)

## Before You Begin

### Check Database State

Check the MySQL service state of the agent. The MySQL database service should be in the "Started" state for the backup and restore.

- Check the MySQL service on Windows systems:

![database-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/database-1.png)

- Check the MySQL service on Linux systems:


![database-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/database-2.png)

### Check Resource

Log in to ADPS as the operator, go to **Resource**, and you can see the activated and authorized resource on the list and its state is "Online". If the resource is not available, please check *Activate License and Assign Authorization*.

![login-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/login-1.png)

### Check Storage Pool

Log in to ADPS as the operator, go to **Storage Pool**, and check whether there is any storage pool. If a storage pool is not listed, please contact the admin to create one and assign permissions to the operator.

![storaged-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/storaged-1.png)

## Login Resource

### Login Instance for the First Time

1. Before creating the first backup and restore job for the MySQL database, you need to **Login** to MySQL first.

![login-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/login-2.png)


2. Enter the username and password of MySQL to login.

![login-3](../image/mysql/03-mysql/login-3.png)

### Add MySQL Instance Manually

If you cannot find MySQL resource under the host on the **Resource** page, you can add MySQL instance manually.

This method is applicable to the following situations: The agent cannot be installed in some environments, or the agent instance cannot be discovered, resulting in failure to backup, such as:

- MySQL instance in container;
- Unrecognized MySQL instance;
- MySQL derivative version;
- Instance without open port;
- Inaccurate configuration of detected MySQL instance;
- ...

> Note:
>
> - Only the admin can manually add MySQL instances.

1. Click **Resource** on the left side of the page, select the MySQL database host, and click the "**+**" to add MySQL instance.

![login-4](../image/mysql/03-mysql/login-4.png)


2. Enter the username and password of the host in the pop-up window.

![login-5](../image/mysql/03-mysql/login-5.png)


3. Enter **Add MySQL Instance** page. The first step is **Database Connection**. You can select **TCP/IP** or **Local Socket** to connect the database.

- **TCP/IP**

  If you select **TCP/IP**, you need to fill in the host IP, database port, database username and password.

![login-6](../image/mysql/03-mysql/login-6.png)


- **Local Socket**

  If you select **Local Socket**, you need to fill in socket path, database username and password.

![login-7](../image/mysql/03-mysql/login-7.png)


4. After **Database Connection**, the second step is to configure parameters. You can select **Logical** or **Physical** as the parameter type.

- **Logical**

  If you select **Logical**, fill in instance name, mysql command-line tool path, mysqldump path, mysqlpump path and version. This instance can only be used for logical backup and restore.

![login-8](../image/mysql/03-mysql/login-8.png)




- **Physical**

  If you select **Physical**, fill in instance name, data directory, mysql command-line tool path, mysqldump path, mysql.cnf path, binlog path and version. This instance can be used for logical and physical backup and restore.

![login-9](../image/mysql/03-mysql/login-9.png)


5. After **Parameters**, the last step is to activate database resource. The license type is checked by default, and you need to authorize the resources to the corresponding user group. Click **Submit** to add the MySQL instance.

![login-10](../image/mysql/03-mysql/login-10.png)

## Create Backup Jobs

This chapter introduces how to back up the MySQL databases.

### Prerequisites

- You have installed the agent. For installation, please refer to *Install and Configure Agent*.

- You have activated the license and assigned the authorization. For details about the activation and authorization, see *Activate License and Assign Authorization*.

- Log in to ADPS as the *operator*.

- Least privilege for the database user running the backup:
  ```{tabularcolumns} |\Y{0.15}|\Y{0.60}|\Y{0.25}|
  ```
  ```{table} Least Privilege for the User
  ---
  class: longtable

  | Back Type                          | Least Privilege for the User             | Note                              |
  | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
  | Physical backup                    | SELECT, RELOAD, PROCESS, LOCK TABLES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, (SUPER) | Require BACKUP_ADMIN for MySQL8.0 |
  | Logical backup (Single channel)    | SELECT                                   |                                   |
  | Logical backup (Multiple channels) | SELECT, RELOAD, EXECUTE, SHOW VIEW, EVENT, LOCK TABLES |                                   |
  ```

### Create Full Backup Jobs

(1) Click **Backup**, select the MySQL database host and instance.

(2) Select **Full** as the **Backup Type**, select the database instance to be backed up and click **Next**. Physical backup supports full backup, incremental backup, log backup, continuous log backup, and synthetic backup. Incremental backups, log backups, and continuous log backups are created based on full backups.

![full_backup-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/full_backup-1.png)

(3) Select **Backup Target**. You can choose standard storage pools, de-duplication storage pools, tape library pools, object storage service pools and LAN-Free pools.

>  Note:
>
>  - It is not supported to store full backups, incremental backups and log backups in different storage pools.

(4) Go to **Backup Schedule** to set the run time of the backup job. For details, see *Backup Schedule Operation*. It is generally recommended to run a full backup on a weekly basis.

(5) Set **Backup Options**, including common options and advanced options.

- **Common options**:

![full_backup-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/full_backup-2.png)

**Compression**: Fast is enabled by default. When compressing data, you can choose between fast and none compression.

**Channels**: This option can improve backup efficiency. The default number of channels is 1 and the range is 1 to 255. For details, please refer to *Channel Number Configuration*.

**binlog**: You can enable this option to restore to a specific time point.  This operation requires to restart the database. Please operate with caution.

**File name**: It refers to the basic file name of the binary log. You can specify the path, but MySQL must have access permissions to the specified path.

**Format**: It refers to the binary log format. You can select ROW, STATEMENT or MIXED.

**Synchronizing binary log number**: It refers to the number of transactions that need to be synchronized from the cache to the disk. When the transaction commit reaches the set number, it will be synchronized to the disk. The value ranges from 0 to 4294967295. 0 means to disable synchronous flushing, and the timing of the synchronization is determined by the operating system. The number affects database efficiency and data consistency. The larger the value, the higher the efficiency and the lower the data consistency.

- **Advanced options**:

![full_backup-3_1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/full_backup-3_1.png)

![full_backup-3_2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/full_backup-3_2.png)

**Reconnection time**: Support 1 to 60 minutes. The job continues after the abnormal reset occurs in the network within the set time.

**Speed limit**: Limit data transfer speed or disk read and write speed. The unit is MiB/s.

**Precondition**: The precondition is executed before the job starts. The job execution is aborted and in the idle state when the precondition is invalid.

**Pre/Post action**: The pre action is executed after the job starts and before the resource is backed up or restored. The post action is executed after the resource is backed up or restored.

**Acquiring database global lock timeout**: The job will be stopped if acquiring database global lock is timed out. 0 means never timeout. The unit is minute.

**Long query threshold**: Do not add lock before long query over this threshold is finished. 0 means no delay. The unit is second.

**Long query timeout**: Time to wait long query to finish. 0 means no delay.

**Log copy interval**: The time interval for copying transaction logs. The unit is millisecond.

**Backup retry count**: When DDL operations are not written to the transaction log, backup will be restarted several times. 0 means no retry.

**Backup retry interval**: When DDL operations are not written to the transaction log, backup will be restarted after a period. The unit is minute.

(6) Set **Job Name**, check whether the job information is correct, and click **Submit**.

### Create Incremental Backup Jobs

It is recommended to create full backup jobs regularly (such as weekly), or create incremental backup jobs at short intervals (such as daily), which ensure that you have at least one recoverable time point every day by only backing up data that has changed since the last backup.

- The steps are the same as steps to create a full backup job. Select **Incremental** as the backup type and choose database instances.

  ![icr_backup-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/icr_backup-1.png)


  > Note:
  >
  > - If the database has never been fully backed up, or has not been fully backed up after restore, the first incremental backup will be run as a full backup by default.

### Create Log Backup Jobs

Based on the periodic full backups and incremental backups, you can also frequently add log backups to back up the binary logs of the database separately. The appropriate log backup frequency depends on the balance between your tolerance for the risk of job loss and the number of log backup you can store, manage and potentially restore. A log backup every 15 to 30 minutes may be sufficient. But if your business requires to minimize the risk of job loss, you can consider running more frequent log backups. Frequent log backups also have the advantage of increasing the frequency of log truncation, making log files smaller.

- The steps to create a log backup are similar to steps to create a full backup. Select **Log** as the backup type and choose database instances.

  ![log_backup-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/log_backup-1.png)


  >  Note:
  >
  >  - It's necessary to enable the binlog on the MySQL database before creating a log backup.

- **Backup Options** -> **Common** provides **Backed-up binary logs** option.

  ![log_backup-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/log_backup-2.png)

**Delete after backup**: Only log backup and continuous log backup have this backup option.

- Checked: Delete the backed-up binary logs when the log backup is completed or after the continuous log backup is stopped.
- Unchecked: When the log backup is completed or the continuous log backup is stopped, the backed-up binary logs will be automatically deleted by MySQL according to configuration.

### Create Continuous Log Backup Jobs

Continuous log backup can constantly back up MySQL binary log files to the real-time backup pool. It requires MySQL to enable binary log, configure server_id, and use full backup sets as the base. An instance can run only one continuous log backup job at the same time. When a full backup job runs, a continuous log backup job will enter a queued state. A new full backup job is required for the MySQL host that completed the restore job to continue the continuous log backup job.

- The steps to create a continuous log backup are similar to steps to create a full backup. Select **Continuous Backup** as the backup type and choose database instances.

  ![con_backup-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/con_backup-1.png)


  >  Note:
  >
  >  - Only the real-time backup pool can be selected as the backup target pool for MySQL continuous log backup.


### Create Logical Backup Jobs

Logical backup jobs can back up single or multiple databases.

- The steps are the same as steps to create a full backup. Select **Logical** as the backup type and choose one or more databases.

  ![logical-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/logical-1.png)


  > Note:
  >
  > - MySQL on Windows platform only supports logical backup jobs.


### Create Synthetic Backup Jobs

The first MySQL synthetic backup is a full backup and each subsequent backup is an incremental backup. Each incremental backup is synthesized with its dependent full backup to generate a new synthetic backup set. It supports iSCSI and FC storage.

 Prerequisites of creating a synthetic backup:

1. The data disk of the storage server requires the ZFS file system. For installation, please refer to the *PBBA Operating System Partition*.
2. Before use, you need to configure the iSCSI/FC link between the agent and the storage server.
3. The admin has the advanced **License** of MySQL Synthetic Backup and MySQL Copy Data Management.
4. The admin has created and assigned a database synthetic pool to the operator.

(1) The steps to create a synthetic backup are similar to steps to create a full backup. Select **Synthetic Backup** as the backup type and choose database instances.

![merge-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/merge-1.png)


(2) Select **Backup Target**. The backup target can only be the database synthetic pool. If the database synthetic pool is not listed, you should contact the admin to create one.

![merge-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/merge-2.png)


(3) Select **Backup Schedule** to set the run time of the backup job. For details, see *Backup Schedule Operation*. It is generally recommended to run a synthetic backup on a daily basis.

(4) Set **Backup Options**, including common options and advanced options. The advanced options are similar to those in full backups but without reconnection time, resumption buffer size, and speed limit.

![merge-3](../image/mysql/03-mysql/merge-3.png)

![merge-4](../image/mysql/03-mysql/merge-4.png)

(5) Set **Job Name**, check whether the job information is correct, and click **Submit**.

## Create Restore Jobs

This chapter introduces how to restore MySQL databases. According to the actual needs of users, ADPS provides a variety of restore types including timepoint restore, logical recovery, instant recovery, restore logs and recovery testing.

> Note:
>
> - MySQL timepoint restore jobs will restart the MySQL service and overwrite the data of the source database. Therefore, you need to reset the original scheduled job, and execute a full database backup before the next log backup.
> - If the recovered resource is a MySQL cluster, after the physical restore, check whether the master-slave replication of the cluster can be started normally. If it is not started, you need to start it manually.

### Prerequisites

- You have a completed backup job. See *Create Backup Jobs*.
- To restore to another host, it's required to install the agent on that host, activate its license and assign the authorization.

### Create Timepoint Restore Jobs

When a logical error occurs in the MySQL database or a disaster occurs in the database, you can use timepoint restore to restore the database to a specified point-in-time state. MySQL timepoint restore supports restoring to the source host or a different host.

(1) Select the MySQL database host and instance, and click **Next**.

(2) Select **Timepoint Restore** as the restore type, select the database instance to be recovered, and click **Next**. Select a specific point in time to restore among the three options provided including restore to point-in-time, restore to GTID, and restore to backup state (shortest recovery time).

- **Restore to Point-in-time**

  If you have executed a log backup or a continuous log backup job, you can run the timepoint restore job by dragging the slider control or manually entering to specify the point in time of the database that needs to be restored.

![time_restore-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/time_restore-1.png)


- **Restore to GTID**

  This restore type is available only when you have enabled GTID and completed a log backup or continuous log backup. You can run a timepoint restore job via Restore Branch and the specified GTID number.

![time_restore-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/time_restore-2.png)


- **Restore to Backup State (shortest recovery time)**

  Select **Restore to Backup State (shortest recovery time)**, you can restore full backup sets, incremental backup sets, and synthetic backup sets. The restore job will not restore the binlog.

![time_restore-3](../image/mysql/03-mysql/time_restore-3.png)


> Note:
> - If the host to be restored is a MySQL cluster, you can select the log backup sets of all nodes in the cluster. Before the log backup starts, the full backup sets and incremental backup sets will be displayed in the drop-down box in the form of time points. After the log backup completes, the full backup sets, incremental backup sets and log backup sets is automatically merged to a time period. You can restore the instance to data at any point in time from the last full or incremental backup to the last log backup by selecting a point in time on the slider control.
> - If the host to be restored is a MySQL cluster, the Backup Sets page will have a filter option. When restoring log backup sets, you can use the filter to ignore specific databases.

(3) Set **Restore Target**. The restore target can be MySQL single host or cluster. When the restore target is a cluster, all nodes of the cluster will run the restore job.

(4) Set **Restore Schedule**. Timepoint restore only supports immediate and one-time restore schedules. Click **Next**.

(5) Set **Restore Options**. The restore options have common options and advanced options.

- **Common options**:

  In the common options, you can set the database username and password of the restore target.

![time_restore-4](../image/mysql/03-mysql/time_restore-4.png)


- **Advanced options**:

  In the advanced options, you can set reconnection time, resumption buffer size, speed limit, precondition, pre/post action, database service startup script, database service stop script, skip grant tables while applying binlog, accelerate applying binglog, force apply binlog, MySQL service startup timeout, and cache directory.

![time_restore-5_1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/time_restore-5_1.png)

![time_restore-5_2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/time_restore-5_2.png)

**Skip grant tables while applying binlog**: You can enable this option to avoid the problem of forbidden access to the binary logs due to insufficient permissions when restoring the logs.

**Accelerate applying binlog**: Accelerate the speed of restoring binlog.

**Force apply binlog**: You can enable this option to continue applying binlog when an error occurs.

**Cache directory**: When restoring incremental backup sets, if you set cache directory, timepoint restore will first download the incremental backup sets to the cache directory, then restore the sets. If you do not set cache directory, the incremental backup sets will be directly restored to the data directory of MySQL.

(6) Confirm whether the restored content is correct, and submit the job after confirming that it is correct.

### Create Logical Restore Jobs

When data loss occurs in a MySQL database such as data files damaged or deleted by mistake, the database or some data files can be restored to the latest state through the logical restore function.

> Note:
>
> - The least privileges required for a database user to start a logical restore are CREATE, DROP, SUPER, INSERT.

(1) Select **MySQL** database host and instance. Click **Next**.

(2) Select **Logical Recovery** as the restore type, select the database to be restored, and click **Next**.

![logical_restore-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/logical_restore-1.png)


(3) Set **Restore Schedule**. Logical restore only supports immediate and one-time restore schedules. Click **Next**.

(4) Set **Restore Options**. The restore options have common options and advanced options.

- **Common options**:

  In common options, you can set restore database methods, and overwrite the original database is set by default, or you can restore to the new database by entering the new database name.

![logical_restore-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/logical_restore-2.png)


- **Advanced options**:

  In advanced options, you can set reconnnection time, resumption buffer size, speed limit, precondition, pre/post action and additional parameters.

(5) After confirming the restore content, click **Submit** and allow the job to be executed.

### Create Instant Recovery Jobs

You can only run instant recovery on instances with MySQL synthetic backups.

>Note:
> - If the storage pool that stores the synthetic backup sets is iSCSI, the iSCSI initiator should be installed on the agent that runs the restore job.
> - If the storage pool that stores the synthetic backup sets is FC, the corresponding HBA API Driver of HBA card should be installed on the agent that runs the restore job.
> - When the target of instant recovery is cluster, all nodes of the cluster will run instant recovery job at the same time. ADPS mounts different LUNs on every node.

The interface offers two portals to create instant recovery jobs and clone copies: **Restore** and **CDM**.

#### Create from Restore Menu

(1) Enter **Restore** main menu, select MySQL database host and instance, and click **Next**.

(2) Select **Instant Recovery** as the restore type. Instant recovery supports restoring to point-in-time, GTID, and backup state (shortest recovery time). Click **Next**.

- **Restore to Point-in-time**

  If you have executed a log backup or a continuous log backup job, you can run the instant recovery job by dragging the slider control or manually entering to specify the point in time of the database that needs to be restored.

![instant_restore-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/instant_restore-1.png)


- **Restore to GTID**

  This restore type is available only when you have enabled GITD and completed a log backup or continuous log backup. You can run an instant recovery job via Restore Branch and the specified GTID number.

![instant_restore-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/instant_restore-2.png)


- **Restore to Backup State (shortest recovery time)**

  Select **Restore to Backup State (shortest recovery time)**. This restore job will only restore synthetic backup sets but not binlog.

![instant_restore-3](../image/mysql/03-mysql/instant_restore-3.png)


(3) Set **Restore Target**. You can restore to different host or other MySQL instances on the source host. Click **Next**.

(4) Set **Restore Schedule**. You can choose immediate or one-time restore schedules. Click **Next**.

(5) Set **Restore Options**, including common options and advanced options.

- **Common options**:

  In common options, you can set the configuration file of MySQL database, and username and password for the backup source.

![instant_restore-4](../image/mysql/03-mysql/instant_restore-4.png)

**Database configuration file**: Click **Browse** or manually fill in the configuration file path of the MySQL database. If you leave it empty, the default configuration file will be used.

**Database username for the backup source**: Enter the database username for the backup source manually. If you leave it empty, it will use the username of the current login resource (i.e. the target database).

**Database password for the backup source**: Enter the database password for the backup source manually. If you leave it empty, it will use the password of the current login resource (i.e. the target database).

- **Advanced options**:

  In advanced options, you can set precondition, pre/post action, database service startup/stop script, storage protocol, skip grant tables while applying binlog, accelerate applying binlog, force apply binlog, keep the mount point even if job fails, and MySQL service startup timeout.

![instant_restore-5_1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/instant_restore-5_1.png)

![instant_restore-5_2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/instant_restore-5_2.png)

**Database service start script**: You can set the command used to start the MySQL service. The database service script starts with this command by default.

**Database service stop script**: You can set the command used to stop the MySQL service. The database service script stops with this command by default.

**Storage protocol**: You can create a new FC Target or iSCSI Target to run instant recovery. Backup sets that are backed up to an iSCSI database synthetic pool can be restored instantly using FC and vice versa. This function requires that the operator has the administrative permission.

**Keep the mount point even if job fails**: This option allows the job to retain the mount point even if the job fails.

**MySQL service startup timeout**: The duration to wait for the target MySQL database to start when running instant recovery.

(6) Set **Job Name**, check whether the job information is correct, and click **Submit**.

#### Check Successful Recovery

After the instant recovery is completed, enter the **CDM** menu. You can find a recovery history record under the backup point in time of the corresponding host and instance.

![cdm-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/cdm-1.png)

#### Detach Copy

You can detach the mounted directory from the agent using the **Detach** icon. If the directory that you want to detach has any applied data files, detaching the mounted directory will delete the database at the same time. Please operate with caution.

- Click the **Detach** icon beside the data copy record.

  ![cdm-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/cdm-2.png)

- Pay attention to the warning and enter the verification code.

  ![cdm-3](../image/mysql/03-mysql/cdm-3.png)

### Create Restore Logs Jobs

You can only create restore logs jobs when the database has executed a log backup or a continuous log backup. Restore logs jobs only download the logs to the agent specified directory and do not execute the restore operations.

(1) Select MySQL database host and instance. Click **Next**.

(2) Select **Restore Archived Logs** as the restore type and select **Restore to Point-in-time** or **Restore to GTID**. Click **Next**.

- **Restore to Point-in-time**

  You can run the restore logs job by dragging the slider control or manually entering to specify the point in time of the database that needs to be restored.

![log_restore-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/log_restore-1.png)


- **Restore to GTID**

  The restore type is available only when you have enabled the GITD. You can run the restore logs job via Restore Branch and the specified GTID number.

![log_restore-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/log_restore-2.png)


(3) Set **Restore Schedule**. It only supports immediate and one-time schedules. Click **Next**.

(4) Set **Restore Options**, including common options and advanced options.

- **Common options**:

  In common options, you can set binlog destination.

![log_restore-3](../image/mysql/03-mysql/log_restore-3.png)


- **Advanced options**:

  In advanced options, you can set reconnection time, resumption buffer size, speed limit, precondition and pre/post action.

![log_restore-4](../image/mysql/03-mysql/log_restore-4.png)


(5) Confirm the job settings, click **Submit** and wait for the job to be executed.

### Create Recovery Testing Jobs

Recovery testing verifies the integrity and availability of backup sets. With the hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly schedule, it can restore the latest backup sets of MySQL to other instances on target host or source host. It is required that the target host and the storage server where the backup sets are located can communicate with each other.

(1) Select MySQL database host and instance. Click **Next**.

(2) Select **Recovery Testing** as the restore type, select the instance or database to be restored, and click **Submit**. You can use **Rename** to specify the database name after recovery.

![exercise-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/exercise-1.png)


(3) Set **Restore Target**. It supports restoring to other MySQL instance on different host or source host. Click **Next**.

(4) Set **Restore Schedule**. It supports hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedules. Click **Next**.

(5) Set **Restore Options**, including reconnection time, speed limit, pre action and post action. Click **Next**.

(6) Confirm the job settings and click **Submit**.

(7) Wait for the job cycle to be executed, and the latest backup sets of the source host will be restored when the restore job is executed.

## Manage Jobs

On the **Job** interface, you can view the backup and restore job information of all agents, start, modify, clone, and delete the jobs.

![job-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/job-1.png)


- Start: Click  ![job-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/job-2.png) to start the job immediately.
- Modify: Click ![job-3](../image/mysql/03-mysql/job-3.png) to modify the basic job information, the backup/restore schedule, and the backup/restore options.
- Clone: Click ![job-4](../image/mysql/03-mysql/job-4.png) to create multiple similar backup jobs.
- Delete: Click ![job-5](../image/mysql/03-mysql/job-5.png) to access the confirmation window. Click **OK** to delete the job.

## Backup Protection Strategy
###  Backup Schedule Operation
ADPS provides 6 types of backup schedules. The schedule type selected is only valid for the currently created job.

![time-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/time-1.png)

- Immediate: The job starts immediately after it is submitted.
- One Time: The job starts to run at a specific time. After the job is submitted, the job will be in an idle state and start to run when the specific run time is reached.
- Hourly: The job runs after a specified number of hours according to the setting. The value range is an integer between 1 and 24.
- Daily: The job runs after a specified number of days according to the setting. The value range is an integer between 1 and 5.
- Weekly: The job runs after a specified number of weeks according to the setting. You can also set the number of weeks and specify which day of the week to run the job.
- Monthly: The job runs after a specified number of months according to the setting. You can also set the week/day and specify which week/day of the month to run the job.

>  **Example: Perform the job every two weeks on Friday at 18:00**

![time-3](../image/mysql/03-mysql/time-3.png)

> **The actual execution time is:**
>
> - If the current time is Friday 17:00, the run time is Friday 18:00 (the current day).
> - If the current time is Thursday 17:00, the run time is Friday 18:00 (the next day).
> - If the current time is Saturday 17:00, the run time will be next Friday 18:00.
> - After the first run is completed, the job will start automatically at 18:00 on Friday every two weeks.

### Backup Strategy Advice

There are six methods to back up MySQL: full backup, incremental backup, log backup, continuous log backup, logical backup and synthetic backup. Full backup, incremental backup, and log backup can be used together. Synthetic backup and log backup can be used together. It is recommended to formulate the following backup strategy according to different situations such as network bandwidth, business data volume, security requirements, and the amount of lost data that you can tolerate.

1. When the application traffic is relatively small, run a **Full Backup** once a week to ensure that you have at least one recoverable RTO every week.
2. After that, you can run an **Incremental Backup** every day to reduce the backup time and ensure that you have at least one recoverable RPO every day.
3. If the database supports log backup, you can run a **Log Backup** every few hours to ensure that the restore granularity RPO can reach the second level. For example, you can run a log backup every 2 hours.

> Note:
>
> - Avoid using the strategies of all full backups or a full backup followed by cumulative incremental or log backups.

## Channel Number Configuration

- Description of Channel number for backup jobs

  MySQL supports up to 255 channels. You can set the number of channels for backup and restore jobs according to the actual environment. A reasonable number can improve job performance. The number of channels is generally recommended to be consistent with that of CPU cores. The efficiency improvement will not be obvious if the number of channels exceeds that of CPU cores.

- Description of Channel number for restore jobs

  The channel number for a restore job is the same as that for the backup job. The restore page does not have the Channel option by default.
## MySQL Cluster

ADPS supports MySQL master-slave and dual-master replication. Before the backup and restore, you must bind the MySQL nodes into clusters.

### Master-Slave Replication

Each node of the cluster is required to complete the environment deployment by referring to *Install and Configure Agent* as well as *Activate License and Assign Authorization*.

##### Cluster Binding

1. Go to **Resource** -> **Cluster**. Click **Cluster Binding**.

![cluster-1](../image/mysql/03-mysql/cluster-1.png)

2. Customize the cluster binding name. Select **Primary Node**, select **Master Slave Replication** as the **Type**, and select slave nodes as the **Nodes**. You can set the **Keepalived Configuration File** as you need. **Preferred Backup Node** is none by default but you can set it according to your needs. Click **Submit**.

![cluster-2](../image/mysql/03-mysql/cluster-2.png)


##### Backup and Restore

- After the master-slave replication cluster is bound, the backup and restore type of the MySQL master-slave is the same as that of the single instance.
- When creating a backup job, you can only see the active nodes of MySQL master and slave. Select MySQL of the active nodes as the backup object. The remaining steps are similar to *Create Backup Jobs*.
- When MySQL master-slave node switches, the new active node will automatically take over the backup job.

### Dual-Master Replication

##### Cluster Binding

1. Go to **Resource** -> **Cluster**. Click **Cluster Binding**.
2. Customize the cluster name, select **Primary Node**, select **Dual-master Replication** as the **Type**, and select other primary nodes in the cluster as the **Nodes**. You can set the **Keepalived Configuration File** as you need. **Preferred Backup Node** is none by default but you can set it according to your needs. Click **Submit**.

![cluster-3](../image/mysql/03-mysql/cluster-3.png)

##### Backup and Restore

When creating a backup job, select the primary node of MySQL as the backup object, and the remaining steps are similar to *Create Backup Jobs*.
