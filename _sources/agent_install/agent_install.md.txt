## Prepare Installation Packages

You can contact Aurreum technical support to get ADPS software packages. The version of the ADPS agent must be the same as the version of the ADPS backup server software. Mixed-version installation and use will lead to installation failure and abnormal function. Different operating systems require different agent packages.

## Install Agent

### Install on Windows

1. Copy the agent installation package to a drive partition with enough space.

2. Double-click the installation package to open the setup wizard.

3. Select the resource modules to be installed.

   You can select the resource types to install their backup and restore modules. During installation, the database resources, files, or applications installed on the agent are selected by default. Resource types include File, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, DB2, Informix, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Sybase, SharePoint, Domino, and Exchange.

   ![](../image/agent_install/install-7.png)

4. Enter the IP of the backup server, SSL encryption (optional), and Access Key (applicable to multi-tenant scenarios).

   ![](../image/agent_install/install-8.png)

5. Select Destination Folder.

6. Wait for the installation.

7. After the installation, log in to the backup server as the admin. The host is on the **Resource** list.

   ![](../image/agent_install/install-12.png)

### Install on Linux

#### Local Install

Upload the installation package to the agent for manual installation and configuration. Run the package with root privileges in the directory where the package resides.

##### CentOS & Red Hat

1. Install dependent packages and agent service software packages.

   ```
   rpm -ivh adps-common-version.x86_64.rpm adps-agent-version_x86_64.rpm
   ```

2. Install resource backup and restore packages. Add the corresponding packages in the following command according to your needs. Take File resource as an example:

   ```
   rpm -ivh adps-agent-file-version_x86_64.rpm
   ```

3. After the installation, configure the agent. Set the IP address, port, SSL protocol, and Access Key to connect to the backup server. The Access Key identifies the user who can register and activate the agent. You can log in to ADPS and see the account's Access Key in **Personal Settings** -> **Settings**. If you leave it blank, the Access Key of the admin is used by default, which means that only the admin has the privilege to register and activate the agent. If you enter the Access Key of a specific user, then the user will also be allowed to register and activate the agent.

   0305&accesskey=22446ab0094d412£84fcc6bf3bd8fele&xm=&tool=curl" | sh
   ```

#### Optional Configuration

##### Reconfigure Agent

Reconfigure the ADPS Agent when the agent instance is unable to automatically detect the already-installed backup and restore modules of Oracle, Informix, Sybase, PostgreSQL, Domino, and Caché.

Execute the following commands:

- Configure Oracle Home directory: /etc/init.d/adps-agent config oracle

- Configure Informix Home directory: /etc/init.d/adps-agent config informix

- Configure Sybase username: /etc/init.d/adps-agent config sybase

- Configure PostgreSQL HOME directory: /etc/init.d/adps-agent config postgres

- Configure Domino config home and Domino program home:

  #/etc/init.d/adps-agent config domino

  Please input Domino config home[]:/local/notesdata/

  Please input Domino program home[]:/opt/ibm/domino/notes/latest/linux

- Configure Caché HOME directory:

  #/etc/init.d/adps-agent config cachedb

  Please input InterSystems Caché home[]:/opt/cache

##### Configure VMware

1. To back up and restore VMware, the backup host should configure VDDK. Add VDDK as follows:

   ```
   tar -zxvf vddk.tar.gz -C /opt/aurreum/adps/
   ```

2. The unzipped directory contains the VDDK version. During the backup and restore, the VDDK version is automatically selected according to the ESXi version. You can also specify the VDDK version.

   - VDDK:

     - 6.0

     - 6.5

     - 6.7

     - 7.0

##### Configure Hadoop

1. In the Linux environment, install the Hadoop runtime environment before installing the Hadoop backup agent.

   - Unzip the Hadoop runtime environment offline package:

	```
   sudo tar -axf hadoop-2.10.0.tar.xz
   ```
   - Install OpenJDK:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jre-headless
   ```

> Note: Fill in the JRE installation directory and version. The default directory is under /usr/lib/jvm/

2. Install and configure Hadoop backup agent.

   - Input JRE home. For example:

     ```
     /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/jre
     ```

   - Input Hadoop home. For example:

     ```
     /home/user/hadoop-2.10.0
     ```
   
   - To reconfigure Hadoop runtime environment, enter the following command:

     ```
     sudo dpkg-reconfigure adps-agent-hadoop
     ```
### Install on AIX

1. Install dependent packages and agent service software packages.

   ```
   rpm -ivh --nodeps --ignorearch adps-common--version_pcc64.rpm adps-agent-version_pcc64.rpm adps-agent-file-version_pcc64.rpm
   ```

2. Install resource backup and restore packages. Add the corresponding package in the following command according to your needs. Take File resource as an example:

   ```
   rpm -ivh --nodeps --ignorearch adps-agent-file-version_pcc64.rpm
   ```

3. After the installation, configure the agent. Set the IP address, port, SSL protocol, and Access Key to connect to the backup server. The Access Key identifies the user who can register and activate the agent. You can log in to ADPS and see the account's Access Key in **Personal Settings** -> **Settings**. If you leave it blank, the Access Key of the admin is used by default, which means that only the admin has the privilege to register and activate the agent. If you enter the Access Key of a specific user, then the user will also be allowed to register and activate the agent.

   ```
   #/etc/init.d/adps-agent config
   Please input Aurreum Data Protection Suite Backup Server host[]: 192.168.18.110
   Please input Aurreum Data Protection Suite Backup Server port[50305]:
   Does Aurreum Data Protection Suite Backup Server enable SSL protocol? [N]:
   Please input Aurreum Data Protection Suite Backup Server access key[]:
   Saving adps-agent config
   Do you want to restart adps-agent? [Y]:
   Stopping adps-agent
   0513-044 The adps-agent Subsystem was requested to stop.
   Waiting for adps-agent to stop.
   Starting adps-agent
   0513-059 The adps-agent Subsystem has been started. Subsystem PID is 18284820.
   ```

4. After the configuration, log in to the backup server as the admin. The host is on the **Resource** list.

   ![](../image/agent_install/install-14.png)

### Install on HP-UX

1. To unzip adps--version-ia64.depot.gz, execute the following command with root privileges:

   ```
   sudo gunzip /tmp/adps-version-ia64.depot.gz
   ```

2. Install the agent and modules. For example, the absolute path of the unzipped package is /tmp/adps-version-ia64.depot. Install the Oracle module. Execute the command with root privileges as follows:

   ```
   swinstall -s /tmp/adps-version-ia64.depot  adps.agent-oracle
   ```

3. After the installation (or to change the current backup server), execute the configuration command:

   ```
   sudo /sbin/init.d/adps-agent config
   ```

4. After the configuration, log in to the backup server as the admin. The host is on the **Resource** list.

   ![](../image/agent_install/install-15.png)

### Install on Solaris

1. Select the corresponding installation package according to the Solaris system, bits, and resource. Take the Solaris 9 SPARC 64-bit as an example. Execute the unzip command with root privileges:

   > Note: This command will completely remove the software packages and the configuration files.

   ```
   sudo apt-get purge adps-common
   ```

### CentOS & Red Hat

This method is applicable to uninstall the agent on Linux with the PRM package manager.

- Execute the command with root privileges to uninstall a module. For example, uninstall the adps-agent-file module.

   ```
   rpm -e adps-agent-file
   ```

- Execute the command with root privileges to uninstall all ADPS components.

   ```
   rpm -e `rpm -qa | grep adps`
