![](../image/03-hana/hana_login01.png)

### Check Storage Pool

Log in to the ADPS console as an operator, go to the **Storage Pool** page, and check whether the operator has been assigned any storage pools. If no storage pool is present, contact the admin to create one and assign it to the operator.

![](../image/03-hana/hana_storage01.png)

## First Time Login

Before you create the first backup and restore, SAP HANA login is required. On the **Resource** page, click **Login** next to SAP HANA.

![](../image/03-hana/hana_login02.png)

> Note:
>
> - Enter the Access Key of the operator for the normal backup and restore functions.
> - After restoring SYSTEMDB to a different host, re-import the license into the database on the restore target.

## Create Backup Job

This chapter introduces how to back up SAP HANA databases. 

### Prerequisites

- An agent has been installed. For details, see *Install and Configure Agent*.
- The license has been activated and users have been authorized to operate the resource. For details, see *Activate License and Authorize User*.
- Open a browser and log in to the ADPS console as an operator.

### Create On Demand Jobs

When the transaction logs are full or the time reaches the log backup setting, the On Demand log backup job will be performed automatically.

1. Open the **Backup** page. At the **Hosts and Resources** step, select the host and SAP HANA instance.

2. At the **Backup Source** step, select **On Demand** as the backup type and choose databases as the backup source. 

	![](../image/03-hana/hana_backup01.png)

3. At the **Backup Target** step, select a storage pool. The target can be a standard storage pool, de-duplication storage pool, local storage pool, tape library pool, or object storage service pool.

4. At the **Backup Options** step, set the common and advanced options.

	- **Common options**:

	![](../image/03-hana/hana_backup02.png)

	**Compression**: The **Fast** option is enabled by default.

	> None: During the backup, the data will not be compressed.
	>
	> Tunable: You can customize the compression level. This option requires an activated feature of Advanced Compression.
	>
	> Fast: During the backup, the data will be compressed by fast compression algorithms.

	- **Advanced options**:

	![](../image/03-hana/hana_backup03.png)

	**Reconnection time**: This option supports 1 to 60 minutes. The job continues after the abnormal reset occurs in the network within the set time.

	**Speed limit**: You can set speed limits for multiple time periods. The unit can be MiB/s or KiB/s.

	**Precondition**: The precondition is checked before the job starts. The job execution is aborted when the precondition is invalid.

	**Pre/Post action**: The pre action is executed after the job starts and before the resource is backed up or restored. The post action is executed after the resource is backed up or restored.

6. At the **Finish** step, set a job name and confirm the job information. Click **Submit**.

### Create Full Backup Job

You can create a full backup job to back up one or more databases.

1. Open the **Backup** page. At the **Hosts and Resources** step, select the host and SAP HANA instance.

2. At the **Backup Source** step, select **Full** as the backup type and choose databases as the backup source. 

   ![](../image/03-hana/hana_backup04.png)

3. At the **Backup Target** step, select a storage pool. The target can be a standard storage pool, de-duplication storage pool, local storage pool, tape library pool, or object storage service pool.

4. At the **Backup Schedule** step, set the execution time for the job. For details, see *Backup Schedule Operation*.

5. At the **Backup Options** step, set the common and advanced options. For details, see the introduction in *Create On Demand Jobs*.

6. At the **Finish** step, set a job name and confirm the job information. Click **Submit**.

### Create Incremental Backup Jobs

Incremental backups only back up data that has changed since the last backup. 

- The procedure to create an incremental backup is the same as for a full backup. Select **Incremental** as the backup type and choose databases.

![](../image/03-hana/hana_backup05.png)

### Create Cumulative Incremental Backup Jobs

Cumulative incremental backups only back up data that has changed since the last full backup. 

- The procedure to create an incremental backup is the same as for a full backup.  Select **Cumulative Incremental Backup** as the backup type and choose databases.

![](../image/03-hana/hana_backup06.png)

## Create Restore Jobs

This chapter introduces how to restore SAP HANA databases.

### Prerequisites

- A backup job has been completed.
- To restore to another host, install an agent on that host, activate the license, and authorize users to operate the resource.

### Create Timepoint Restore Jobs

When a disaster occurs in a SAP HANA database, Timepoint Restore can help you to restore the database to a specified point-in-time state.

1. Open the **Restore** page. At the **Hosts and Resources** step, select the host and SAP HANA instance. Click **Next**.

2. At the **Backup Sets** step, select a database that you want to restore and drag the slider control to specify a restore point in time. Click **Next**. 

	![](../image/03-hana/hana_restore01.png)

3. At the **Restore Target** step, select a resource as the restore target. The target can be the source or a different host. Click **Next**.

> Note: 
>
> - The restore target should have the same database mode as the restore source. 
>
> - The target instance version should be newer than or equal to the source instance version.

4. At the **Restore Schedule** step, set the execution time for the job. Only immediate and one-time schedule types are supported. Click **Next**.

5. At the **Restore Options** step, set the options according to your needs, including reconnection time, speed limit, and pre/post action.

6. At the **Finish** step, set a job name and confirm the job information. Click **Submit**.

## Manage Jobs

The **Job** page provides the job information of all agents. You can start, modify, clone, and delete the jobs.

![](../image/03-hana/hana_job01.png)

- Start: Click ![](../image/03-hana/hana_job02.png) to start the job immediately.
- Modify: Click ![](../image/03-hana/hana_job03.png) to modify the basic job information, backup/restore schedule, and backup/restore options.
- Clone: Click ![](../image/03-hana/hana_job04.png) to create multiple similar backup jobs.
- Delete: Click ![](../image/03-hana/hana_job05.png) to access the confirmation window. Click **OK** to delete the job.

## Backup Protection Strategy

### Backup Schedule Operation	

ADPS provides six types of backup schedules. The schedule type selected is only valid for the currently created job.

![](../image/03-hana/hana_time01.png)

- Immediate: The job immediately starts to run after it is submitted.
- One Time: After the job is created, it will be in an idle state and start to run when the specified Start time is reached. 
- Hourly: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of hours/minutes within the time range according to the setting. If you select Hour as the unit, you can set the value from 1 to 24. If you select Minute, you can set the value from 1 to 60.
- Daily: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of days according to the setting. The value is an integer between 1 and 5.
- Weekly: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of weeks according to the setting. You can specify which day of the week to run the job.
- Monthly: The job runs on the specified days of some months at the specified time. For example, you can set the job to run on January 1 and June 1 at 20:00. Or you can set it to run on the first Monday of every month at 20:00.

> **Example: Run a job every two weeks on Friday at 18:00**

> ![](../image/03-hana/hana_time03.png)

> **The execution time will be:**
>
> - If the current time is Friday at 17:00, the execution time will be Friday at 18:00 (the current day). 
> - If the current time is Thursday at 17:00, the execution time will be Friday at 18:00 (the next day).
> - If the current time is Saturday at 17:00, the execution time will be next Friday at 18:00.
> - After the first run is completed, the job will start automatically at 18:00 on Friday every two weeks.

### Backup Strategy Advice	

ADPS offers four SAP HANA backup types: On Demand, full backup, incremental backup, and cumulative incremental backup. It is recommended to formulate the following backup strategy according to different situations such as network bandwidth, business data volume, security requirements, and the amount of data loss that you can tolerate.

1. When the application traffic is relatively small, run a **Full Backup** once a week to ensure that you have at least one recoverable point in time every week.
2. After that, you can run a **Cumulative Incremental Backup** every day to reduce the backup time and ensure that you have at least one recoverable point in time every day.

> Avoid using the following strategies:
>
> - Perform only full backups.
> - Perform one full backup followed by all incremental or cumulative incremental backups.

## SAP HANA Cluster

ADPS supports the backup and restore for SAP HANA clusters. Before you back up and restore a cluster, bind the SAP HANA nodes into a cluster. Deploy the environment of each node in the cluster according to *Install and Configure Agent* as well as *Activate License and Authorize User*.

### Cluster Binding

1. Go to **Resource** -> **Cluster**. Click the **Cluster Binding** icon.

	![](../image/03-hana/hana_cluster01.png)

2. Customize the cluster name. Select the active node as the **Primary Node**, "Active-Passive" as the **Type**, and the inactive node as the **Nodes**. Click **Submit**.

	![](../image/03-hana/hana_cluster02.png)

### Backup and Restore

SAP HANA cluster has the same backup and restore types as the single instance.

- The **Backup** page displays only the active nodes in the SAP HANA cluster. Select an active node as the backup source. The remaining steps are similar to those in *Create Backup Jobs*.
- When a switchover occurs in the nodes of the SAP HANA cluster, the new active node will automatically take over the backup job.
- When creating a restore job, you can select a single instance or cluster as the restore target.
