![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_storage01.png)

## Create Backup Jobs

This chapter introduces how to back up object storage.

### Prerequisites

- The object storage agent has been installed. For installation, see *Install and Configure Agent*.
- The object storage has been added. For details, see *Add and Configure Object Storage*.
- The license has been activated, and the resource has been authorized to users.
- Log in to ADPS as the *operator* with the resource authorized.

### Create Full Backup Jobs

All buckets can be backed up.

1. Click **Backup** and select the object storage host and resource.

2. Select **Full Backup** as the backup type. Choose buckets and files that you want to back up.

	![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_backup01.png)

3. Select **Agent**. Ensure that the selected agent can communicate with the object storage host.

	![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_backup02.png)

4. Select **Backup Target**. 

5. Select **Backup Schedule** to set the execution time of the backup job. For details, see *Backup Schedule Operation*. 

6. Set **Backup Options**, including common and advanced options.

	- **Common options**:

	![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_backup03.png)

	**Compression**: Fast is enabled by default.

	> - None: During the backup, the data will not be compressed.
	> - Tunable: You can customize the compression level. This option requires an activated feature of Advanced Compression.
	> - Fast: During the backup, the data will be compressed by fast compression algorithms.

	**Channels**: This option can improve backup efficiency. The default value is 1 and the range is from 1 to 255. For details, please refer to *Channel Number Configuration*.

	- **Advanced options**:

	![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_backup04.png)

	**Reconnection time**: This option supports 1 to 60 minutes. The job continues after the abnormal reset occurs in the network within the set time. The unit is minute.

	**Speed limit**: This option can limit data transfer speed or disk read and write speed. The unit is MiB/s.

	**Precondition**: The precondition is checked before the job starts. The job execution is aborted when the precondition is invalid.

	**Pre/Post action**: The pre action is executed after the job starts and before the resource is backed up or restored. The post action is executed after the resource is backed up or restored.

7. Set the **Job Name**, and check whether the job information is correct. Click **Submit**.

### Create Incremental Backup Jobs

Incremental backup jobs are created based on full backup jobs. They back up only the data that has changed since the last full backup.

- Creating an incremental backup is the same as creating a full backup. Select **Incremental Backup**, and choose a full backup as the base. The incremental backup job will be performed according to the storage buckets and files selected in the full backup.

	![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_backup05.png)

> Note:
>
> - Only the full backup requires a Backup Target. Incremental backups have the same backup target as the full backup selected as their base.

### Create Synthetic Backup Jobs

Synthetic backup combines a full backup and some incremental backups into a new full backup. It can reduce periodic full backups, save storage, and improve backup and recovery efficiency.

1. Creating a synthetic backup is similar to creating a full backup. Select **Synthetic Backup**. Choose buckets and files.

	![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_backup06.png)

2. Select **Agent**.

3. Select **Backup Target**. The backup target can only be a file synthetic pool. If no file synthetic pool is present, please contact the admin to create one.

	![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_backup07.png)

4. Select **Backup Schedule** to set the execution time of the backup job. For details, see *Backup Schedule Operation*. 

5. Set **Backup Options** according to your needs.

6. Set the **Job Name** and check whether the job information is correct. Click **Submit**.

## Create Restore Jobs

This chapter introduces how to restore object storage.

### Prerequisites

- A backup job is completed. See *Create Backup Jobs*.
- To restore to another host, install an agent on that host, activate the license and authorize users.

### Create Timepoint Restore Jobs

When a folder or file of the object storage is lost, it can be restored to a specified point-in-time state through Timepoint Restore. 

1. Select the object storage host and resource. Click **Next**. 

2. Select **Timepoint Restore** and choose a backup point in time that you want to restore. The backup points in time of incremental backup sets are under their base full backup. Click **Next**.

	![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_restore01.png)

3. Set **Restore Target**. The restore target can be the source or another host. Click **Next**.

	![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_restore02.png)

4. Select **Agent**. Click **Next**.

5. Set **Restore Schedule**. It only supports immediate and one-time schedules. Click **Next**.

6. Set **Restore Options**. In the common options, you can set **Channels**. The maximum number of channels cannot exceed that of the backup job. You can also set the **Restore Location** to the original path or enter a path manually. Click **Next**.

	![](../image/03-obs/obs_restore03.png)

7. Set the **Job Name** and confirm the job information. Click **Submit**. 

### Create Instant Recovery Jobs

The instant recovery mounts the synthetic backup sets to the restore target through the NFS protocol. Mounting backup sets over the Internet does not require reading and transferring data, which can reduce the recovery time. 

> Note:
>
> - To use object storage instant recovery, install the nfsd package on the storage server. 

#### Create from Restore Menu 

1. Go to the **Restore** page. Select the object storage host and resource. Click **Next**.

2. Select **Instant Recovery** and choose a backup point in time that you want to restore. Click **Next**. 

	![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_restore04.png)

3. On the **Export** interface, set the export directory and access control list for the backup set. Click **Next**.

	![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_restore05.png)

	- **Export**: Set the export mount point.
	- **Access control list**: This option refers to the list of agents where the backup set can be mounted. It supports IP address or CIDR. * means that all agents can access the backup set. 
	- **Conversion path coding**: Set the path coding. The default path coding for mounting and restoring files is UTF-8.
	- **Bridge**: Use a bridged network to export backup sets. It can avoid conflicts with the system's NFS service.

	> Note: 
	>
	> - The 4th bit of the IP address in the **Bridge** option is required to be entered manually. The IP address must be a valid one that has not been used in this network segment.
	>
	> - To set the Bridge, install bridge-utils and edit the /etc/network/interfaces configuration file. Add the following:
	>
	>   ```
	>   auto br0
	>   iface br0 inet static
	>   address 192.168.88.10
	>   netmask 255.255.255.0
	>   gateway 192.168.88.1
	>   bridge_ports eth0
	>   bridge_stp off
	>   bridge_fd 0
	>   ```

4. Confirm the job information. Click **Submit**.

## Backup Protection Policy

###  Backup Schedule Operation	

ADPS provides six types of backup schedule types. The schedule type selected is only valid for the currently created job.

![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_time01.png)

- Immediate: The job immediately starts after it is submitted.
- One Time: After the job is created, the job will be in an idle state and start to run when the specified execution time is reached.
- Hourly: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of hours/minutes within the time range according to the setting. If the unit is Hour, you can set the value from 1 to 24. If you select the Minute as the unit, then the value can be set from 1 to 60.
- Daily: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of days according to the setting. The value is an integer between 1 and 5.
- Weekly: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of weeks according to the setting. You can specify which day of the week to run the job.
- Monthly: The job runs on the specified days of some months at the specified time. For example, you can set the job to run on January 1 and June 1 at 20:00. Or you can set it to run on the first Monday of every month at 20:00.

**Example: Run the job every two weeks on Friday at 18:00**

![  ](../image/03-obs/obs_time03.png)

**The execution time will be:**

- If the current time is Friday at 17:00, the execution time will be Friday at 18:00 (the current day).
- If the current time is Thursday at 17:00, the execution time will be Friday at 18:00 (the next day).
- If the current time is Saturday at 17:00, the execution time will be next Friday at 18:00.
- After the first run is completed, the job will start automatically at 18:00 on Friday every two weeks.

### Backup Policy Advice	

ADPS offers three backup types for object storage: full backup, incremental backup, and synthetic backup. It is recommended to formulate the following backup policy according to different situations such as network bandwidth, business data volume, security requirements, and the amount of data loss that you can tolerate.

1. Run a **Full Backup** once a week when the application traffic is small to ensure that you have an RTO of one week. 
2. After that, you can run an **Incremental Backup** every day to reduce the backup time and ensure that you have an RPO of one day.

> Avoid using the following strategies:
> - Perform only the full backups.
> - Perform a full backup followed by all incremental backups. 

## Channel Number Configuration	

Object storage supports up to 255 channels. You can set the channel number for the backup and restore jobs according to your environment, but the value you set for the restore job cannot exceed that of the backup job. A reasonable number of channels can improve job performance, which is recommended to be the same as the number of CPU cores in the agent. The efficiency improvement will not be obvious if the number of channels exceeds that of CPU cores.
