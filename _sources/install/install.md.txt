## ADPS Components

ADPS components include Backup Server, Storage Server, and Agent.

**Backup Server**: It is responsible for managing the connections of the Backup Agent and Storage Server. It can monitor and manage the business information of each agent resource, including backups and restores, and the information of storage servers.

**Storage Server**: It is responsible for receiving and storing data as well as processing the recycling mechanisms of backup data. The Backup Server and Storage Server components can be installed on the same or different devices. One backup server can manage multiple storage servers to achieve storage scalability.

**Agent**: It is responsible for responding to the commands of the backup server console as well as performing the backup and restore jobs. The Agent is installed on the server where users store business data. It will be managed by the backup server after their connection.

## Installation Process

This document introduces the process of installing a new ADPS system in the environment where the backup server and storage server are installed on the same device (i.e., an engineered data protection appliance). Please follow the steps below.

Step 1. Prepare the environment

Step 2. Update the kernel

Step 3. Install MariaDB

Step 4. Install ADPS

Step 5. Connect the Catalog database

Step 6. Install online manual

Step 7. Install optional modules

Step 8. Install auxiliary tools

Step 9. Open access ports

Step 10. Check the service state

### Server Requirements

The following are the hardware requirements for the ADPS backup/storage server. You can refer to the server configuration of the Aurreum Data Protection Appliance (ADPA). If you use an outdated server, problems such as incompatibility may occur.

1. Architecture

   A physical server or virtual machine with a 64-bit x86 architecture is required.

2. Memory

   ```{tabularcolumns} |\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.18}|\Y{0.32}|
   ```
   ```{table} Memory
   | Item                          | Standard Configuration         | Minimum Configuration | Instruction                                                  |
   | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Software installation         | More than 32 G                 | More than 16 G        | Less than 16 G may result in unacceptable performance.       |
   | CDM or de-duplication service | At least 1.5‰ of the data disk | More than 16 G        | For example, if the data disk space is 64 T, the storage server memory should be at least 96 G. |
   ```

3. Storage

   The storage of the backup/storage server is classified into: system disk and data disk.

   ```{tabularcolumns} |\Y{0.28}|\Y{0.72}|
   ```
   ```{table} Storage
   | Storage     | Recommendation                                               |
   | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | System disk | Use the Solid-State Drive (SSD) as the system disk, at least two SSDs of 120 G or above, and create a RAID1. |
   | Data disk   | Equip multiple mechanical Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) for the data disk, which depends on the hardware server configuration and business volume. |
   ```

4. Network

   Use at least two network interface cards (GE/10GE) for isolating networks for different usages such as management and storage. If there are scenarios of LAN-Free function and database synthetic backups, an iSCSI/FC HBA card is also required. See the *Appendix* for the compatible models of the supported HBA card.

   > For hardware servers other than ADPA, you need to handle the compatibility issues of hardware devices and system software by yourselves, including network interface card and HBA card.

5. Operating system

   The following operating systems are supported for the backup/storage server:

   ```{tabularcolumns} |\Y{0.33}|\Y{0.33}|\Y{0.33}|
   ```
   ```{table} Operating system
   | Operating System | CPU Architecture | Operating System Bits |
   | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
   | Ubuntu 18.04     | x86              | 64                    |
   | CentOS 7.6       | x86              | 64                    |
   ```

6. File system

   (1) System disk

   Use LVM to create VG (systemvg)  on the system disk and then create LV on the systemvg. The recommended system partitions are:

   ```{tabularcolumns} |\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|
   ```
   ```{table} System disk 
   | Partition | Mount Point | Partition Size   | File System |
   | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
   | boot      | `/boot`     | 512 MiB          | ext2        |
   | rootlv    | `/`         | 32 GiB and above | xfs         |
   | swaplv    | `swap`      | 16 GiB and above | swap        |
   ```
   (2) Data disk

   An XFS or ZFS file system is required to be created on the data disk. To achieve LAN-Free function and database synthetic backups, a ZFS file system should be created. For other scenarios, an XFS file system should be created.

   **XFS file system**

   Use LVM to create VG (infokistvg) on the data disk and create the following infokistlv on infokistvg.

   ```{tabularcolumns} |\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|
   ```
   ```{table} XFS file system
   | Partition  | Mount Point | Capacity            | File System Type |
   | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
   | infokistlv | `/infokist` | All data disk space | XFS              |
   ```

   **ZFS file system**

   If a ZFS file system is created on the data disk, you should configure JBOD mode (pass-through mode) on the RAID controller. Use the zpool create command to create an infokist pool on the data disk and then mount the pool to the /infokist directory.

   ```{tabularcolumns} |\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|
   ```
   ```{table} ZFS file system
   | ZFS pool | Mount Point | Capacity            | File System Type |
   | -------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
   | infokist | `/infokist` | All data disk space | ZFS              |
   ```

   First, check the device ID of each hard disk. For example, /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c7dcd2 is the device ID of /dev/sda.

   ```
   ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/
   ```
   
   Create ZPOOL. Take 24 HDDs for example.

   ```
   Check the HDD physical sector size
   sudo blockdev --getpbsz /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c7dcd2
   4096
   ```

   If the physical sector size of the disk is 4 KiB (i.e. "Advanced Format": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Format), then

   ```
   sudo zpool create -f -m /infokist -o ashift=12 infokist \
   raidz2 \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c7dcd2 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c81fa3 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8259e \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8273b /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c82b67 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c82d9e \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c83674 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c836e4 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c840eb \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c846dd /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c848a6 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8509f \
   raidz2 \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c76773 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c79f59 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8080a \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c82df7 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8371d /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c837e9 \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c837f7 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c84cf8 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c84cfd \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c84cff /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8508f /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c85193
   ```

   If the physical sector size of the disk is 512 B, then

   ```
   sudo zpool create -f -m /infokist infokist \
   raidz2 \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c7dcd2 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c81fa3 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8259e \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8273b /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c82b67 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c82d9e \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c83674 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c836e4 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c840eb \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c846dd /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c848a6 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8509f \
   raidz2 \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c76773 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c79f59 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8080a \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c82df7 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8371d /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c837e9 \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c837f7 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c84cf8 /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c84cfd \
      /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c84cff /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c8508f /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000cca271c85193
   ```

   After the creation, ZPOOL will be automatically mounted to the /infokist directory. You can use the df -h command to check the results.

7. Set the time zone

   Set the time zone of the operating system as that of your current location. The recommended modification command is:

   ```
   sudo timedatectl set-timezone <your_time_zone>
   ```

### Prepare Software Packages

You can contact our technical support to get the required ADPS packages. The versions of the products installed on all ADPS components must be the same. Mixed version installation may result in abnormal Web access and functions. The following table shows the packages and their functions:

```{tabularcolumns} |\Y{0.50}|\Y{0.50}|
```
```{table} Prepare Software Packages
| Software Package                                          | Function                                                     |

```

### Update the Kernel

If you create a ZFS file system on the data disk of the operating system, you must update the kernel to the internal source version (not the public source version) before installing the ADPS software. Otherwise, it will affect the normal use of LAN-Free and database synthesis functions. The operation is as follows:

- Ubuntu

   (1) Execute the following commands with root privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo tar -zvxf 5.4.0-115_zfs0.8.6_ubuntu1804_amd64.tar.gz
   cd 5.4.0-115_zfs0.8.6_ubuntu1804_amd64
   sudo dpkg -i kernel/*
   ```

   (2) After updating the kernel, you must restart the server.

- CentOS

   (1) Execute the following commands with root privileges:

   ```bash
   tar -zvxf 5.4.96-200.el7_zfs0.8.6_centos76_x86_64.tar.gz
   rpm -Uvh kernel/*
   ```

   (2) After updating the kernel, you must restart the server.

> The kernel has hardware adaptation compatibility issues. Therefore, the hardware server is better in the same version as the ADPA. Otherwise, updating the kernel may lead to compatibility problems, like the server cannot be started or the operating system is damaged.

### Install MariaDB Database

1. Installation method

   * Ubuntu

   ```bash
   sudo tar -zvxf Ubuntu1804_amd64_MariaDB10.6.tar.gz
   cd Ubuntu1804_amd64_MariaDB10.6
   sudo sh install_MariaDB10.6.sh
   ```

   * CentOS

   ```bash
   sudo tar -zvxf Centos7_x86-64_MariaDB10.6.tar.gz
   cd Centos7_x86-64_MariaDB10.6
   sudo sh install_MariaDB10.6.sh
   ```

2. Set the root password

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mariadb
   sudo mysqladmin -u root password 'xxxxxx'   #(xxxxxx is the password that you set for the root user)
   ```

3. Modify the configuration file

   Add sql_mode, remote access, and other settings on the MariaDB configuration file. Modify the /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf configuration file on Ubuntu and the /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf configuration file on CentOS.

   (1) Add sql_mode

      ```bash
      [mysqld]
      sql_mode='ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY'
      ```

   (2) Enable remote access. Set the bind address to 0.0.0.0

      ```bash
      [mysqld]
      bind-address = 0.0.0.0
      ```

   (3) Use root to log in to MariaDB and grant remote access privileges to root.

      ```bash
      mysql -u root -p
      MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'xxxxxx';  #(xxxxxx is the password that you set for the root user)
      MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
      ```

   (4) Restart MariaDB

      ``` bash
      sudo systemctl restart mariadb
      ```

4. Set MariaDB to start on boot

   ```
   sudo systemctl enable mariadb
   ```

### Install ADPS Software

#### Ubuntu

1. In the directory where the installation package is located, execute the following commands in sequence with root privileges:

   ```
   sudo dpkg -i adps-common_version_amd64.deb adps-backupd_version_amd64.deb adps-storaged_version_amd64.deb adps-nginx_version_amd64.deb adps-infokist_version_amd64.deb|| sudo apt-get -y -f install
   ```

2. Configure adps-storaged and set the IP address of the backup server, e.g., 192.168.88.239

   ![](../image/install/install-3.png)

3. Set the port of the backup server. The default port is 50305, which means that the data is transferred without encryption. You can encrypt the data by modifying the port to 60305.

   ![](../image/install/install-4.png)

4. If you enter 50305 in the previous step, choose "No" to disable the SSL protocol. If you enter 60305, choose "Yes" to enable the SSL protocol.

   ![](../image/install/install-5.png)

5. Wait for the installation to complete. After the installation, symbolic links will be created between the ADPS-related directories and the /infokist under the data disk.

> Install the adps-infokist package after the installation of the adps-storaged package. Otherwise the /infokist directory space may not be available.

#### CentOS

1. In the directory where the installation package is located, execute the following commands in sequence with root privileges:

   ```
   rpm -i adps-common_version_x86_64.rpm  adps-backupd_version_x86_64.rpm adps-storaged_version_x86_64.rpm adps-nginx_version_x86_64.rpm rpm -i adps-infokist_version_x86_64.rpm
   ```

2. Wait for the installation to complete. After the installation, symbolic links will be created between the ADPS-related directories and the /infokist under the data disk.

3. After the installation, configure adps-storaged:

   ```bash
   /etc/init.d/adps-storaged config
   Please input Aurreum Data Protection Suite Backup Server host[]:     ##Enter the IP address of the backup server here, e.g., 192.168.88.239
   Please input Aurreum Data Protection Suite Backup Server port[]:     ##Enter the port of the backup server here. The default port of the system: 60305
   Does Aurreum Data Protection Suite Backup Server enable SSL protocol?[N]:     ##Enter Yes here
   Saving adps-storaged config[OK]:       ##Press "Enter" to save the configuration modification
   Do you want to restart adps-storaged[Y]:    ##Enter Y here to restart the service
   ```

### Connect Catalog Database

The ADPS catalog needs to be connected to the MariaDB database.

```
sudo /etc/init.d/adps-backupd config mysql
Please input mysql host[]: 127.0.0.1
Please input mysql port[3306]:
Please input mysql user[root]:
Please input mysql password:
Loaded /opt/aurreum/adps/lib/libmysqlclient.so.18 with flags 0x00000101(RTLD_LAZY | RTLD_GLOBAL)
Test MySQL connectivity OK!
Select Y when you see the following prompt;
Do you want to restart backupd? [Y]:y
[ ok ] Restarting adps-backupd (via systemctl): adps-backupd.service.
```

### Install Online Manual

This step aims to enable the ADPS Web console to display the online manual. Execute the manual run script (manual_run/manual-*.run) with root privileges and enter it according to the prompt.

```
chmod +x manual-version.run
./manual-version.run
```

## Install Optional Modules

### Install LAN-Free Module

If you create a ZFS file system on the data disk of the operating system, then install the adps-storaged-lanfree software package on the storage server to run LAN-Free backups and database synthetic backups through iSCSI/FC Target. The installation commands are:

#### Ubuntu

1. Install the lio-utils and zfsutils-linux dependent packages

   ```bash
   sudo tar -zvxf 5.4.0-115_zfs0.8.6_ubuntu1804_amd64.tar.gz
   cd 5.4.0-115_zfs0.8.6_ubuntu1804_amd64
   sudo dpkg -i lio-utils/*  #For there may be installation package dependencies, execute twice
   sudo dpkg -i zfsutils-linux/*
   ```

2. Install the adps-storaged-lanfree software package

   ```
   sudo dpkg -i adps-storaged-lanfree_version_amd64.deb
   ```

#### CentOS

1. Install the lio-utils and zfsutils-linux dependent packages

   ```bash
   tar -zvxf 5.4.0-115_zfs0.8.6_ubuntu1804_amd64.tar.gz
   rpm -ivh lio-zfs-utils/lio-utils-3.1-11.noarch.rpm

   ```
   rpm -ivh adps-storaged-lanfree_version_amd64.deb
   ```

### Install Tape Library Controller Module

To back up the data to the tape library, you need to install the adps-controller package on the server and make it the tape library controller. The tape library controller must be connected to the tape library over the IP-SAN or FC-SAC network. And the adps-controller handles all requests from the agent to the tape library. The installation commands are:

#### Ubuntu

   ```
   sudo dpkg -i adps-controller_version_amd64.deb
   ```

#### CentOS

   ```
   rpm -ivh adps-controller_version_x86_64.rpm
   ```

### Install Instant File Recovery Module

To achieve instant file recovery, you need to install the adps-nfsd package on the storage server. Then the file backup sets of the storage pool can be mounted on the agent. The installation commands are:

#### Ubuntu

   ```
   sudo dpkg -i adps-nfsd_version_amd64.deb
   ```

#### CentOS

   ```
   rpm -ivh adps-nfs_version_x86_64.rpm
   ```

## Install Auxiliary Tools

We recommend installing auxiliary tools such as lzop, zip, sqlite3, and rpm gnupg to facilitate subsequent system operation and maintenance.

## Open Access Ports

For the safe running of the system, open the firewall and set the access ports according to the following list.

```{tabularcolumns} |\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.25}|
```
```{table} Open Access Ports List

## Check Service State

After the installation, check whether the following ADPS services are running normally:

```
adps-backupd
adps-storaged
adps-nginx
adps-controller
mariadb
```

For example, you can check the adps-backupd service according to the following commands. The active state means that the service is running normally. The query commands for other services are the same.

```
/etc/init.d/adps-backupd  status
● adps-backupd.service - adps backup server daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/adps-backupd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Tue 2022-05-17 13:54:37 CST; 2 days ago
 Main PID: 6064 (adps-backupd)
    Tasks: 11 (limit: 1111)
   CGroup: /system.slice/adps-backupd.service
           └─6064 /opt/aurreum/adps/bin/adps-backupd --reactor=dev_poll -f /etc/opt/aurreum/adps/backupd/svc.conf.d
