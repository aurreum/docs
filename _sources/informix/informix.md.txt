## Create Backup Jobs

This chapter introduces how to back up the Informix databases.   

### Prerequisites

- You have installed the agent. For installation, please refer to *Install and Configure Agent*. 
- You have activated the agent and assigned the authorization. For details about the activation and authorization, see *Activate License and Assign Authorization*. 
- Log in to ADPS as the *operator*. 

### Create Full Backup Jobs

Informix full backup allows for database instance backup but not a single database backup. It backs up all online, non-temporary storage space and logical logs, as well as onconﬁg, sqlhosts, ixbar, and oncfg ﬁles. Informix full backup corresponds to the Level-0 backup.

(1) Click **Backup**. Select the Informix host and instance.

(2) Select **Full Backup** as the **Backup Type**. Select the databases.

![](../image/03-informix/informix_backup01.png)

(3) Select **Backup Target**. You can choose standard storage pools, de-duplication storage pools, tape library pools, object storage service pools and LAN-Free pools.

>  Note: 
>
>  - It is not supported to store full backups, incremental backups/cumulative incremental backups and log backups in different storage pools. 
>  - Perform a full backup to the storage pool before using it for Informix backups.

(4) Go to **Backup Schedule** to set the execution time of the backup job. For details, see *Backup Schedule Operation*. It is generally recommended to run a full backup on a weekly basis. 

(5) Set **Backup Options**, including common options and advanced options.

- **Common options**:

![](../image/03-informix/informix_backup02.png)

**Compression**: **Fast** is enabled by default.

- None: No compression during the backup.
- Tunable: You can customize the compression level. This option requires an activated feature of Advanced Compression.
- Fast: Use the fast compression algorithms during the backup.

**On-Bar**: When you run an Informix backup job for the first time, On-Bar will be configured by default and a full backup job will be executed. Configuring On-Bar is an one-time operation that is only required for the first backup. If your Informix version is lower than 12.10, the database will be shut down and be restarted during the On-Bar configuration, and it is recommended that you schedule job execution in idle business time. On-Bar configuration modifies the following values in $INFORMIXDIR/etc/onconﬁg file: BAR_BSALIB_PATH, BAR_MAX_BACKUP, and LTAPEDEV.	

**Channels**: Used to improve backup efficiency. The default value of Channels is 1 and the range is 1 to 255. For details, refer to *Channel Number Configuration*.

- **Advanced options**:

![](../image/03-informix/informix_backup03.png)

**Reconnection time**: The job continues after the abnormal reset occurs in the network within the set time. The value can be 1 to 60. The unit is minute(s).

**Speed limit**: Set the limit for data transfer speed or disk read and write speed. The unit can be MiB/s or KiB/s. Click the ‘’+‘’ icon to add limits at different times.

**Precondition**: The precondition is checked before the job starts. The job execution is aborted when the precondition is invalid.

**Pre/Post action**: The pre action is executed after the job starts and before the resource is backed up or restored. The post action is executed after the resource is backed up or restored.

(6) Set **Job Name**, check whether the job information is correct. Click **Submit**.

### Create Incremental Backup Jobs

An incremental backup is created based on a full backup. It only backs up data that has changed since the last backup, including all online, non-temporary storage space and logical logs, as well as onconﬁg, sqlhosts, ixbar, and oncfg ﬁles. Informix incremental backup corresponds to the Level-2 backup. It is recommended to create full backup jobs regularly (such as weekly), or create incremental backup jobs at short intervals (such as daily).  

- Creating an incremental backup job is the same as creating a full backup job. Select **Incremental Backup** as the backup type. 

  ![](../image/03-informix/informix_ib01.png)
  
> Note: 
>
> - If the database has never been fully backed up, or has not been fully backed up after the restore, the first incremental backup will be run as a full backup by default.

### Create Cumulative Incremental Backup Jobs

A cumulative incremental backup is created based on a full backup. It only backs up data that has changed since the last full backup, including all online, non-temporary storage space and logical logs, as well as onconﬁg, sqlhosts, ixbar, and oncfg ﬁles. Informix cumulative incremental backup corresponds to the Level-1 backup. It is recommended to create full backup jobs regularly (such as weekly), or create cumulative incremental backup jobs at short intervals (such as daily). 

- Creating a cumulative incremental backup job is the same as creating a full backup job. Select **Cumulative Incremental Backup** as the backup type. 

  ![](../image/03-informix/informix_cib01.png)
> Note:
>
> - If the database has never been fully backed up, or has not been fully backed up after restore, the first cumulative incremental backup will be run as a full backup by default.

### Create Log Backup Jobs

Informix log backup is created based on a full backup. It backs up the current logical logs and other full logical logs.

- Creating a log backup job is the same as creating a full backup job. Select **Log** as the backup type. 

  ![](../image/03-informix/informix_log01.png)
  
 > Note: 
 > - If the database has never been fully backed up, or has not been fully backed up after the restore, run a full backup job before the log backup job.
 > - To perform the restore job successfully, it is required that full backups and log backups are in the same storage pool.
 > - When a log backup job is running,  the Agent modifies onconfig file parameter LTAPEDEV to a value other than /dev/null.
 > - When a single logical log file is full, this log file will not be automatically marked as backed up. When all logical logs are full and no log backup has been performed since the last backup, the database will hang and become inaccessible. It is recommended that you set the log backup execution cycle according to the speed at which logical logs are generated to avoid database from crashing.

### Create Automatic Archiving Log Backup Jobs

When logical logs are full or when you manually execute log switch command, automatic archiving log backups are performed automatically to back up the current logical logs.

- Creating an automatic archiving log backup job is the same as creating a full backup job. Select **On Demand** as the backup type.

  ![](../image/03-informix/informix_log_od01.png)

  > Note:
  >
  > - Run a full backup job before the first automatic archiving log backup job. 
  > - It is not supported to run an automatic archiving log backup job and a log backup job on the same instance.
  > - Informix version 11.50 configures On-Bar and restarts the instance when the automatic archiving log backup job is running.

## Create Restore Jobs

This chapter introduces how to restore Informix databases. ADPS provides a variety of restore types including timepoint restore, full recovery testing, and continuous recovery testing.

### Prerequisites

- A backup job has been completed. See *Create Backup Jobs*. 
- To restore to another host, it is required to install the agent on that host, activate its license and assign the authorization.  

### Create Timepoint Restore Jobs

When a logical error or a disaster occurs in an Informix database, you can use timepoint restore to restore the database to a specified point-in-time state. Informix timepoint restore supports restoring to the source host or a different host.       

(1) Select the Informix database host and instance, and click **Next**. 

(2) Select **Timepoint Restore** as the restore type, select the backup set and the specific point in time by dragging the slider control.

![](../image/03-informix/informix_restore01.png)

(3) Set **Restore Target**. You can select the source host or a different host as the restore target. Click **Next**.

- **Source host**: The Restore Target page selects the source host by default.

- **Different host**: You can restore to a different host, which requires the same informix version, same instance name, and same path.

(4) Set **Restore Schedule**. It only supports immediate and one-time restore schedules.

(5) Set **Restore Options**. You can set backup tail-log in the common options, and set reconnection time, resumption buffer size, speed limit, precondition, pre action, post action and serial restore in the advanced options.

- **Backup tail-log**: Backup tail-log is the process of backing up logical log files from disks to storage media before a restore job is executed.
   - In case the database instance fails and some logical log data have not yet been backed up to the storage media, it is necessary to enable this option to back up the logical log data if you restore the instance to the point in time of failure. 
   - Log backup is based on a full backup. If you have not executed a full backup job after the restore is completed, disable this option when you execute a restore operation again. 
- **Serial restore**: Set BAR_MAX_BACKUP=1 to start only one thread at each restore. When a restore job requires multiple backup sets that use different channel number, the restore job has the possibility to fail. In this case it is recommended to enable Serial Restore.

(6) Confirm the job information. Click **Submit**.

### Create Full Recovery Testing Jobs

With the hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly schedule, you can use full recovery testing to recover the latest Informix backup set to the specified target host and and verify that the backup set is available.

(1) Select the Informix database host and instance. Click **Next**. 

(2) Select **Full Recovery Testing** as the restore type. This restore type does not require selecting a backup set point in time, because it will restore the latest backup set of the source host when it is executed.

![](../image/03-informix/informix_restore02.png)

(3) Select **Restore Target**. The source instance cannot be selected as the restore target. The selected restore target requires that the database version, instance name, and storage path are consistent with those of the source database. Click **Next**.

(4) Set **Restore Schedule**. It supports hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedule types. Click **Next**.

(5) Set **Restore Options** including reconnection time, speed limit, pre action, and post action. Click **Next**.

(6) Confirm the job information. Click **Submit**.

### Create Continuous Log Recovery Testing Jobs

Continuous recovery testing allows you to create periodic log recovery testing jobs that apply the latest logical log files from the Informix host to the target instance synchronously. 

(1) Select the Informix database host and instance, and click **Next**. 

(2) Select **Continuous Recovery Testing** as the restore type. This restore type does not require selecting a backup set point in time, because it will restore the latest backup set of the source host when it is executed.

![](../image/03-informix/informix_restore03.png)

(3) Select **Restore Target**. The source instance cannot be selected as the restore target. The selected restore target requires that the database version, instance name, and storage path are consistent with those of the source database. Click **Next**.

(4) Set **Restore Schedule**. It supports hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedule types. Click **Next**.

(5) Set **Restore Options** including reconnection time, speed limit, pre action, and post action. Click **Next**.

(6) Confirm the job information. Click **Submit**.

> Note:
>
> - When you submit a continuous log recovery testing job, the page will pop up a window to confirm your submission. See below:
>
>   ![](../image/03-informix/informix_restore04.png)
>
> - When you restore the latest logical log backup set from the Informix host to the specified target host, database on the target host will be in a "Fast Recovery" state, which prevents the database from querying data. In this case you can restore the database on the target host to an "On-Line" state by disabling the continuous log recovery testing.

## Manage Jobs

On the **Job** interface, you can view the backup and restore job information of all agents, start, modify, clone, and delete the jobs.

![](../image/03-informix/informix_job01.png)

- Start: Click ![](../image/03-informix/informix_job02.png) to start the job immediately.
- Modify: Click ![](../image/03-informix/informix_job03.png) to modify the basic job information, the backup/restore schedule, and the backup/restore options.
- Clone: Click ![](../image/03-informix/informix_job04.png) to create multiple similar backup jobs.
- Delete: Click ![](../image/03-informix/informix_job05.png) to access the confirmation window. Click **OK** to delete the job.

## Backup Protection Strategy

###  Backup Schedule Operation

ADPS provides six types of backup schedules. The schedule type selected is only valid for the currently created job.

![](../image/03-informix/informix_time01.png)

- Immediate: The job immediately starts to run after it is submitted.
- One time: After the job is created, it will be in an idle state and start to run when the specified Start time is reached.
- Hourly: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of hours/minutes within the time range according to the setting. If the unit is Hour, then you can set the value from 1 to 24. If you select the Minute as the unit, then you can set the value from 1 to 60.
- Daily: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of days according to the setting. The value is an integer between 1 and 5.
- Weekly: After the job is created, the first run will be initiated at the specified Start Time. The next run will be executed after a specified number of weeks according to the setting. You can specify which day of the week to run the job.
- Monthly: The job runs on the specified days of some months at the specified time. For example, you can set the job to run on January 1 and June 1 at 20:00. Or you can set it to run on the first Monday of every month at 20:00.

>  **Example: Perform the job every two weeks on Friday at 18:00**

> ![](../image/03-informix/informix_time02.png)

> **The actual execution time is:**
>
>  - If the current time is Friday 17:00, the run time is Friday 18:00 (the current day).
>   - If the current time is Thursday 17:00, the run time is Friday 18:00 (the next day).
>   - If the current time is Saturday 17:00, the run time will be next Friday 18:00.
>   - After the first run is completed, the job will start automatically at 18:00 on Friday every two weeks.

### Backup Strategy Advice

There are six methods to back up Informix: full backup, incremental backup, cumulative incremental backup, log backup, and automatic archiving log backup. Full backup, incremental backup, cumulative incremental backup, and log backup can be used together. It is recommended to formulate the following backup strategy according to different situations such as network bandwidth, business data volume, security requirements, and the amount of lost data that you can tolerate.

1. When the application traffic is relatively small, run a **Full Backup** once a week to ensure that you have at least one recoverable RTO every week.
2. After that, you can run an **Cumulative Incremental Backup** every day to reduce the backup time and ensure that you have at least one recoverable RPO every day.
3. It's recommended that you set the cycle of log backup jobs based on the speed at which logical logs are generated.

> Note:
>
> - Avoid using the strategies of all full backups or a full backup followed by cumulative incremental or log backups.

## Configure the Agent Access Mode

The Agent supports using ODBC and DBACCESS to access the databases. 

- If you have installed Informix CSDK (Client Software Development Kit), ODBC access mode will be used by default. 
- If Informix CSDK (Client Software Development Kit) is not installed, you can use the DBACCESS access mode. 

Refer to the following steps to configure DBACCESS for different OS.

1. Configure DBACCESS on Linux

   ```shell
   > /etc/init.d/adps-agent config informix
   Detected Informix home:
   /opt/informix
   Your Choice: /opt/informix
   Enter access mode (ODBC or DBACCESS):DBACCESS
   Stopping adps-agent                                    [  OK  ]
   Starting adps-agent                                    [  OK  ]
   ```

   Verify the successful configuration:

   ```shell
   > cat /etc/opt/aurreum/adps/agent/conf.d/informix.conf
   INFORMIX_DIR=/opt/informix
   INFORMIX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/informix/lib
   # mode: DBACCESS or ODBC
   INFORMIX_ACCESS_MODE=DBACCESS
   ```

2. Configure DBACCESS on Windows

   If CSDK is not installed, DBACCESS will be used automatically. The corresponding InformixAccess registry entries are as follows:

   ```shell
   ## Add Registry
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\aurreum\adps\agent\InformixAccess 
   #String value DBACCESS
   ```

## Channel Number Configuration		

- Channel number for backup jobs

  Informix supports up to 255 channels. You can set the number of channels for backup and restore jobs according to the actual environment. A reasonable number can improve job performance. On-Bar backs up dbspace. If the channel number exceeds the dbspace number, the exceeded channel number will not take effect.

- Channel number for restore jobs

  The channel number for a restore job is the same as that for the backup job. The restore page does not have the Channel option by default.
