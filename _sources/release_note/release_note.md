|{{product}}|{{product}} is the abbreviation of {{title}}.|
|Backup console|Backup console is the terminal operation management interface of {{product}}, used for the registration, the backup and restore of user service resources.|
|Backup server|Backup server is like the brain of the entire backup system. It is used to schedule backup and restore jobs, and record metadata indexes generated by backup and restore management.|
|Agent|Agent refers to the resource agent process of {{product}}, responsible for receiving and running backup and restore jobs. It is generally installed on the host where the business system is located or on the backup host of the virtual platform. Some resource Agents can also be installed on backup servers: for example, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) supports the VMware virtualization with an agent-less backup.|
|Storage server|Storage server is used to receive and store the backup data pushed by the Agent. It can be constructed as a distributed de-duplication cluster. Its underlying storage supports mainstream storage media, including SSD, SAS, NLSAS, SATA and other interface disks; IBM, Quantum, and other mainstream brands of tape libraries, virtual tape libraries, CD storage systems, etc.; Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Cloud, and other mainstream cloud platform storage.|
|Backup set|A backup set is a collection of backup data generated by a backup job.|
|Storage pool|A storage pool is a logical pool created on a storage server. One storage server can create multiple storage pools, and one single storage pool can store numerous backup sets.|
|Pool replication|Pool replication is the reproduction of backup data between two storage pools.|
|Synthetic backup|Synthetic backup means a full backup followed by permanent incremental backups. The backup set from the synthetic backup can be used for instant recovery (minute-level RTO).|
|Continuous log real-time protection|Continuous log real-time protection (CLRP) is {{company}} self-developed technology. It can monitor and capture the log changes of databases in real time to solve the real-time backup problems of databases (second-level RPO).|
|De-duplication|This technology is designed to remove redundant backup data and ensure that the same data information is only saved once on the target storage. It is a general {{product}} function and applies to all resource modules.|
|D2C|D2C is the abbreviation of Disk To Cloud. It means that the source data is directly backed up to the cloud object storage. It is a general {{product}} function and applies to all resource modules.|
|D2T|D2T is the abbreviation of Disk To Tape, which means that the source disk data is directly backed up to tape storage. It is a general {{product}} function and applies to all resource modules.|

## Function Description
### Improve Backup Data Replication Management
#### Storage Pool One-to-Many Replication

The previous version of {{product}} only supported one-to-one or many-to-one replication of storage pools, and the solution of Three Data Centers in Two Places needs to be implemented through cascading replication (A→B→C). For this issue, the new version adds support for one-to-many replication of storage pools, which improves the diversity, timeliness, and reliability of backup data replication.

#### Filter Backup Data for Replication
The previous version only supported replicating all backup data of storage pools. However, the new version supports filtering some backup data for replication. The filter criteria includes backup resource and backup type. Users can choose to copy some core backup data to enhance the replication efficiency, reduce unnecessary storage and bandwidth costs.

#### Start/Stop Job Replication

By manually pausing, starting, and stopping a job, users can control the operation of the job according to the existing network resources.

### Protect the Database
The new version enriches and enhances the support for mainstream databases, and greatly improves the functions and performance of backup and restore. 
#### Oracle
{{product}} supports Oracle's physical and logical backup and restore. For physical backup, it supports full backup, incremental backup, cumulative incremental backup, log backup, continuous log backup (second-level RPO), and synthetic backup. For logical backup, it supports tablespace and table-level backup and restore. 
#### SQL Server
{{product}} supports full backup, cumulative incremental backup, log backup, tail-log backup, and synthetic backup of Microsoft SQL Server.  
#### MySQL
{{product}} supports physical and logical backup and restore of MySQL. Physical backup supports full backup, incremental backup, log backup, continuous log backup, and synthetic backup. Logical backup supports logical export and import of the entire database, and is compatible with logical backup and restore of RDS and MySQL in the container.  
#### PostgreSQL
{{product}} supports full backup, incremental backup, log backup, and logical backup (database, schema, table) of PostgreSQL. 
#### MongoDB
{{product}} supports logical backup, full backup, and log backup of MongoDB. 
#### DB2
{{product}} supports full backup, incremental backup, cumulative incremental backup, automatic archiving log backup, and logical backup of DB2. 
#### Informix
{{product}} supports full backup, incremental backup, cumulative incremental backup, automatic archive log backup, and log backup of Informix. 
#### Sybase
{{product}} supports full backup and log backup of Sybase. 
### Protect File and Application
#### File
{{product}} supports file backup and restore of Linux, Windows, and Unix, and supports full backup, incremental backup, cumulative incremental backup, and synthetic backup. 
#### Object Storage
{{product}} supports full backup, incremental backup, and synthetic backup of object storage. 
#### Hadoop HDFS
{{product}} supports full backup, incremental backup, and synthetic backup of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
#### NDMP
{{product}} supports volume-level full backup and incremental backup of NDMP. 
#### Exchange
{{product}} supports full backup, incremental backup, log backup, MAPI email backup, and EWS email backup of Exchange. It compatibly supports the backup and restore of Office365 Exchange Online.  
#### SharePoint
{{product}} supports full backup of SharePoint. 
#### Domino
{{product}} supports full backup, incremental backup, file full backup (including DAOS file backup), file incremental backup, and archive log incremental backup of Domino database. 
### Operating System
{{product}} supports Linux OS backup, full and incremental backup. This function can also realize the system migration of P2V, V2V, and V2P. 

### Virtualized Security
{{product}} supports the backup and restore of VMware, Hyper-V virtual machines, including full backup and incremental backup.
#### VMware
{{product}} enhances the capabilities to back up and restore VMware. New features include:

- Backup and restore of virtual disks
- Source deduplication
- D2C, D2T
- Multi-version VDDK coexists to perform backup and restore
- HotAdd backup transport mode

#### Hyper-V
{{product}} enhances the capabilities for Hyper-V backup and restore. New features include:

- Virtual disk-based restore (A entire machine backup is still required.)
- Source de-duplication
- D2C, D2T
- For Hyper-V 2016 or later: 
  - New consistent checkpoint level option.
  - Incremental backup is realized based on Hyper-V RCT, and compared to the previous Hyper-V, it allows for no retention of checkpoints.


### Optimize Operations and Maintenance
{{product}} has single-tenant and multi-tenant user systems. These systems are suitable for large, medium, and small enterprises, as well as group companies with a multi-level organizational management structure (group-subsidiary-department). {{product}} supports resource isolation and backup management for users with different permissions. With the powerful job, log, alarm, and storage management functions, it can back up and manage numerous and varied resources consistently and efficiently. During {{product}} operations, each type of metadata is recorded in order, and users can quickly filter by the console interface to view information about resources, jobs, logs, alarms, storage, and other data. The new version of {{product}} adds the following new features to O&M:

#### Specify Agent IP During the Backup and Restore

The previous version used the "Network Setting" function to specify IP for the backup and restore in the case of a multi-IP storage server. For the new version, {{product}} support specifying an agent IP to back up and restore when there are multiple IPs of the agent.

#### Allow Administrator to Operate Tenant Resources

The new "Enable Operating Child Tenant's Resource" option provides centralized operation and maintenance in multi-tenant scenarios. If this option is enabled, Administrator users can create users to directly operate tenant resources, and parent tenant users can use child tenant resources in multi-tenant scenarios.

#### View Running Job Logs
{{product}} can record the running log of the job and display it on the console. Users can clearly identify the running state of the job via the {{product}} interface.  

#### Batch Modify Jobs
{{product}} can batch modify jobs in the storage pool, which is convenient for migrating a large number of backup jobs to other target storage pools.  
#### Set Multiple Email Addresses to Receive Alert Emails 
The previous version allowed one backup user to set up only one Email address to receive the Alert Email. The new version adds a new "Alarm" and "Additional Notification Email" settings. Users can fill in multiple Email addresses in "Additional Notification Email" option to receive alert emails.

#### Optimize Alert Contents

The alert information has been improved in the new version, clearly displaying the cause of errors and suggestions for troubleshooting.
