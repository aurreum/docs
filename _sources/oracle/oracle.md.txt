> When running Oracle RAC synthetic backup, please note that:
>
> - The Target will be mounted to the active node during the backup and the backup job will be performed on the active node. Jobs cannot be performed on the inactive node.
> - During the instant recovery, the disk will be mounted to the active node and then ADPS will recover the disk's data according to the single instance instant recovery. After the recovery, only the active node is available while others are not.
> - During the synthetic backup, please do not run tablespace restores and single table restores. Otherwise, the subsequent instant recovery will fail.

### Check Successful Installation

After the successful installation, you can log in to ADPS as the admin and see that the host is on the **Resource** list.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-07.png)

## Activate License and Assign Authorization

This chapter is applicable to the operation of a single agent. If you have multiple agents, you can deploy them first and then carry out batch activation and authorization. Please refer to *Batch Register/Activate/Authorize* for more details.

### Register Host

Log in to ADPS as the admin and go to **Resource**. Select the host that you need to activate and click the **Register** icon.

   ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-08.png)

### Activate License

In the pop-up **Activate** window, select the resource you want to activate. Click **Submit**.

   ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-09.png)

### Assign Authorization

After the successful activation, you can authorize users to operate the resource in the pop-up **Authorize** window.

   ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-10.png)

## Before You Begin

### Check Database State

Check the Oracle instance state on the agent. The Oracle instance should be in the "OPEN" or "mount" state for the backup and restore.

   ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-11.png)

### Check Resource

Log in to ADPS as the operator and go to **Resource**. You can see that the activated and authorized resource is on the list and its state is "Online". If the resource is not available, please check *Activate License and Assign Authorization*.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-12.png)

### Check Storage Pool

Log in to ADPS as the operator, go to **Storage Pool**, and check whether there is any storage pool. If a storage pool is not present, please contact the admin to create one and assign permissions to the operator.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-13.png)

## Login Instance for the First Time

1. Before creating the first backup and restore, you need to **Login** to the Oracle first.

   ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-14.png)

2. Oracle supports three authentication methods: **Database**, **OS**, and **Access Key**.

- Database authentication: The login account should have the SYSDBA privilege and the roles of RESOURCE and CONNECT. You can log in to Oracle 12c and higher versions as users with the SYSBACKUP privilege.
- OS authentication: You can use root or Oracle installation user to log in the databases. OS authentication is not supported for Oracle databases on Windows. Logical import/export and table restore are not supported when you use OS authentication. If you use root to log in to the server, it will automatically log in to all the database instances on that server. If you use the Oracle installation user, it will only log in to the instances that the user installs.
- Access Key authentication: You can use the Access Key of the user who has been assigned the resource. The job can be performed without a password, which has potential data security risks.

3. Select **Authentication**. Enter **User** and **Password**. Click **Login**.

   ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-15.png)

### Oracle XE

To log in to Oracle XE, please refer to the *Login Instance for the First Time*.

### Oracle RAC

After the Oracle RAC resource is activated, you should use the admin to bind the Oracle RAC nodes into a cluster on the **Cluster** page and log in to the Oracle resources of all nodes. You can log in to all of the resources on the same host, or log in to the resources one by one on the **Backup** page.

### Oracle Hot Standby

After the Oracle hot standby is activated, you should use the admin to bind the nodes into a hot standby cluster on the **Cluster** page and log in to the Oracle resources of all nodes. To log in to Oracle hot standby, please refer to the *Login Instance for the First Time*.

### Oracle One Node

After the Oracle One Node is activated, you should use the admin to bind the nodes into a cluster on the **Cluster** page and log in to the Oracle resources of all nodes. To log in to Oracle One Node, please refer to the *Login Instance for the First Time*.

### Oracle Data Guard

Only the backup and restore of the primary database of Oracle Data Guard are supported. To log in to Oracle Data Guard, please refer to the *Login Instance for the First Time*.

### Oracle Active Data Guard

The backup and restore of the primary and standby databases of Oracle Active Data Guard are supported. To log in to Oracle Active Data Guard, please refer to the *Login Instance for the First Time*.

> Note:
>
> - To use Access Key authentication, the admin should enable the **Access Key login instance** option in the **Settings** -> **Security**.


## Create Backup Jobs

This chapter introduces how to back up the Oracle databases.

### Prerequisites

- You have installed the agent. For installation, please refer to *Install and Configure Agent*.
- You have activated the license and assigned the authorization. For details, see *Activate License and Assign Authorization*.
- Log in to ADPS as the *operator*.

### Create Full Backup Jobs

1. Click **Backup**. Select the Oracle host and instance.

2. Select **Full** as the backup type and choose the databases to be backed up.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-16.png)

3. Select **Backup Target**. You can choose standard storage pool, de-duplication storage pool, tape library pool, object storage service pool, and LAN-Free pool.

>  Note: The same database's full backups, cumulative incremental backups, and log backups cannot be stored in different storage pools.

4. Go to **Backup Schedule** and set the execution time of the backup job. For details, please refer to *Backup Schedule Operation*. We recommend running a full backup on a weekly basis.

5. Set **Backup Options** including common and advanced options.

- **Common options**:

  ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-17.png)

**Compression**: Fast is enabled by default.

**Channels**: This option can improve backup efficiency. The default number is 1 and the range is 1 to 255. For details, please refer to *Channel Number Configuration*.

> Note:
> - When Oracle is backed up to a tape library pool, the channel number will be given a default value based on the number of drives in the tape library, the number of tapes, and whether the backup source is a RAC. If the maximum number that can be filled is bigger than 4, the default value will be 4. Otherwise, the default value is the maximum number that can be filled.
> - Restoring Oracle from a tape library pool only supports one channel and the number cannot be modified.

**When the database is in NOARCHIVELOG mode**:

- Send an alert message and cancel the job: When the database is in NOARCHIVELOG mode, ADPS will cancel the backup job and send an alert message.
- Allow offline backup:  When the database is in NOARCHIVELOG mode, ADPS will send an alert message and perform the backup job offline.
- Enable ARCHIVELOG:  When the database is in NOARCHIVELOG mode, ADPS will enable the ARCHIVELOG mode according to the customized archive log directory or the database default directory, send an alert message, and then perform the backup job.

**BCT**: BCT (Block Change Tracking) is a feature introduced in Oracle 10g. It mainly serves the RMAN incremental backups. You can enable BCT to improve the incremental backup performance. After enabling BCT, you can customize the BCT directory or use the database default BCT directory.

**Minimal supplemental logging**: The log files generated after this option is enabled can be used for LogMiner. This operation is a one-time operation.

**Force logging**: You can enable the force logging mode of the database.

**Reserve archive logs**:

- Delete all archive logs: Delete the backed-up archive logs after the backup.
- Reserve archive logs for N day(s)/hour(s): After the backup, reserve the backed-up archive logs in the previous N day(s)/hour(s) and delete those that are older than N day(s)/hour(s).
- Do not delete archive logs: Do not delete the backed-up archive logs after the backup.

**Encryption wallet password**: If you enable encryption wallet, you are required to enter the encryption wallet password when performing database database backups.

- **Advanced options**:

  ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-18.png)

**Reconnection time**: 1-60 are supported. The unit is minute.

**Speed limit**: You can limit the data transfer speed or data read and write speed. The unit is MiB/s.

**Precondition**: The precondition is checked before the job starts. The job execution is aborted and it becomes idle when the precondition is invalid.

**Pre/Post action**: The pre action is executed after the job starts and before the resource is backed up or restored. The post action is executed after the resource is backed up or restored.

**Archive log backup times**: You can set the archive log backup times. 1-5 are supported.

**Custom RMAN commands**: You can customize RMAN commands and insert them between the allocate channel command and backup command. For example, you can use "set maxcorrupt for datafile xxx to N;" to ignore bad blocks of some files.

**Skip**: You can set this option to skip inaccessible files, offline files, read-only files, and send alerts when these files are skipped.

6. Set **Job Name** and check whether the job information is correct. Click **Submit**.

### Create Incremental/Cumulative Incremental Backup Jobs

We recommend running full database backups regularly (such as weekly) and incremental/cumulative incremental backups at short intervals (such as daily). You can use incremental/cumulative incremental backups to back up data that has changed since the last backup so that you have at least one recoverable point in time every day.

- Creating an incremental/cumulative incremental backup is the same as creating a full backup. Select **Incremental** or **Cumulative Incremental Backup** as the backup type and choose databases.

  ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-19.png)

> Note:
> - If the database has not been fully backed up, or has not been fully backed up after restore, the first cumulative incremental backup will be run as a full backup by default.

### Create Logical Backup Jobs

Logical backup jobs include: Data Pump Export and Traditional Export. ADPS supports the export of database, tablespace, and schema. The export of database and tablespace should use a user with DBA privileges (SYSDBA cannot be used), and the export of schema should use the corresponding user.

1. Creating a logical backup is similar to creating a full backup. Select **Data Pump Export** or **Traditional Export** as the backup type and choose databases.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-20.png)

 > Note that logical backups are disabled or hidden in the following situations:
 > - Data Pump Export will be hidden when the Oracle version is older than 10g.
 > - Data Pump Export will be disabled when
 >   - the Oracle database authentication method is OS authentication;
 >   - the database state is STARTED or MOUNTED;
 >   - read-only is true; or
 >   - the Oracle database is a standby.
 >   Note:
 >
 > - When Traditional Export is selected and the Oracle major version is newer than or equal to 11, the interface will display a prompt: The traditional export of the current version (11.xxx) may fail.
 > - When the database state is OPEN and read_only is false, the interface will display a prompt: The database is in the OPEN READ WRITE status. It is recommended to use Data Pump Export.

2. **Backup Source**:

- Databases: Select the database name and the entire database will be exported. Select the tablespace under the database name and the tablespace will be exported.

- User: Select the user under the user list and the user will be exported. Multi-user export is supported.

3. Select **Backup Target**. The data will be exported to the selected storage pool.

4. Select **Backup Schedule** and set the execution time of the backup job.

5. Set **Backup Options** according to your needs. The options include compression, channels, when the database is in NOARCHIVELOG mode, and reserve archive logs.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-21.png)

6. Set **Job Name** and check whether the job information is correct. Click **Submit**.

### Create Log Backup Jobs

Based on periodic full backups and cumulative incremental backups, you can also frequently add log backups to back up only the transaction logs of the database. The appropriate log backup frequency depends on the balance between your tolerance for the risk of work loss and the number of log backups you can store, manage, and potentially restore. A log backup every 15 to 30 minutes may be sufficient. But if your business requires minimizing the risk of work loss, please consider more frequent log backups. Frequent log backups also increase the frequency of log truncation, resulting in smaller log files.

The log backup is classified into **Log** and **Continuous Backup**.

- **Log**: It backs up Oracle archive logs. When selecting periodic backup schedules, you can set the backup condition at the **Automatically backup archive logs when** option.

- **Continuous backup**: Oracle continuous log backup means that the backup system continuously backs up Oracle online logs and archive logs to the real-time backup pool. When a continuous log backup job is created, it is always running (except for job suspension caused by external factors).

1. Creating a log backup is similar to creating a full backup. Select **Log** or **Continuous Backup** as the backup type and choose databases.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-22.png)

> Note:
>
> - Before creating continuous log backups, you need to perform a full backup or ensure that the storage pool has an available full backup set.
>
> - Continuous log backup jobs can back up only to real-time backup pool and support replications between real-time backup pools.
>
> - You can only create one continuous log backup job for one database instance. If you need to create a new continuous log backup, you should stop or delete the old one.

2. Select **Backup Target**. The logs will be backed up to the selected storage pool.

3. Select **Backup Schedule** to set the execution time of the backup job. You do not need to set the backup schedule for continuous log backups.

4. Set **Backup Options** according to your needs. The options include compression, reserve archive logs, channels, reconnection time, speed limit, precondition and pre/post action. Only compression and pre action are allowed for continuous log backups.

5. Set **Job Name** and check whether the job information is correct. Click **Submit**.

### Create Synthetic Backup Jobs

The first Oracle synthetic backup job will be a full backup and the subsequent ones will be incremental. Each incremental backup will be synthesized with the last one to get a full backup. Then the synthetic backup uses the snapshot function of the database synthetic pool to generate a snapshot point. Oracle synthetic backups support:

- Linux, AIX, as well as Windows 2008 and later platforms;
- Oracle 10g and later versions;
- FC and iSCSI storage types.

1. Creating a synthetic backup is similar to creating a full backup. Select **Synthetic Backup** as the backup type and choose databases.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-23.png)

2. Select a **Data Pool** and set the **Staging Disk Size**. The data files will be backed up to the selected database synthetic storage pool. In the advanced options, you can fill in the ratio between the incremental storage disk and the real-time size of the database to set the volume size for incremental backup set storage. The default value is 100%, and the range is 0-100%. Select a **Log Pool**. Files except for data files, including archive logs, control files, and PFILE/SPFILE, will be backed up to the selected storage pool. If the storage type of the database synthesis pool is iSCSI, you need to install the iscsi initiator on the agent. If it is FC, the agent server needs to be equipped with an HBA card and installed the corresponding HBA API Driver.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-24.png)

3. Select **Backup Schedule** to set the execution time of the backup job.

4. Set **Backup Options**. The options include compression, reserve archive logs, BCT, channels, speed limit, precondition, pre/post action and custom RMAN commands. You can set them according to your needs. If the database has encrypted tablespaces, you need to enter the correct wallet password in the **Encryption wallet password** option.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-25.png)

**Compression**: Fast is enabled by default. You can choose Fast to compress data.

**Channels**: This option can improve backup efficiency. The default number is 1 and the range is 1 to 255. For details, please refer to *Channel Number Configuration*.

> Note:
>
> - When Oracle is backed up to a tape library pool, the channel number will be given a default value based on the number of drives in the tape library, the number of tapes, and whether the Oracle database is a RAC cluster. If the maximum number that can be filled is bigger than 4, the default value will be 4. Otherwise, the default value is the maximum number.
> - Restoring Oracle from a tape library pool only supports one channel and the number cannot be modified.

**Reserve archive logs**:

- Delete all archive logs: Delete the backed-up archive logs after the backup.
- Reserve archive logs for N day(s)/hour(s): After the backup, reserve the backed-up archive logs in the previous N day(s)/hour(s) and delete those that are older than N day(s)/hour(s).
- Do not delete archive logs: Do not delete the backed-up archive logs after the backup.

**Advanced options**:

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-26.png)

**Speed limit**: The data transfer speed or data read and write speed can be limited. The unit is MiB/s.

**Precondition**: The precondition is checked before the job starts. The job execution is aborted and it becomes idle when the precondition is invalid.

**Pre/post action**: The pre action is executed after the job starts and before the resource is backed up or restored. The post action is executed after the resource is backed up or restored.

**Custom RMAN commands**: You can customize RMAN commands and insert them between the allocate channel command and backup command. For example, you can use "set maxcorrupt for datafile xxx to N;" to ignore bad blocks of some files.

**Direct I/O**: To avoid using system cache, this option will not change the filesystem_options parameter of the database.

**Disable synchronous I/O**: It can speed up the backup speed.

**Synthesis method**:

- Synthesize by Oracle RMAN: This method is selected by default.
- Frontend pipeline synthesis: Synthesize the data file immediately after its incremental backup is complete.

 > Note: When you select **Synthesize by Oracle RMAN** and the Oracle database parameter disk_asynch_io is set to false, ADPS will send an alert message and automatically change the synthesis method to **Frontend pipeline synthesis**.

**Scan FC ports**: The FC ports should be scanned if you select database synthetic pool with an FC protocol for synthetic backups. To avoid scanning all ports, you can specify an agent to scan a specific FC port.

5. Set **Job Name** and check whether the job information is correct. Click **Submit**.

## Create Restore Jobs

This chapter introduces how to restore Oracle databases. ADPS provides various restore methods for different needs, including media restore, timepoint restore, logical import, restore archived logs, instant recovery, and recovery testing.

### Prerequisites

- You have a complete backup job. Please refer to *Create Backup Jobs*.
- To restore to another host, you need to install an agent on that host, activate its license, and assign the authorization.

### Create Media Restore Jobs

When a media error occurs in Oracle databases such as data files corruption or accidental deletion, you can restore the databases or some data files through media restore jobs. If the redo logs and archive logs are not lost, running media restores will not lose data. Before creating restore jobs, start the database instance but do not need to mount it.

1. Select the Oracle host and instance. Click **Next**.

2. Select **Media** as the restore type and choose databases to be restored. You can modify the path for restored files. Click **Next**.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-27.png)

3. Set **Restore Schedule**. Only immediate and one-time schedules are supported. Click **Next**.

4. Set **Restore Options** including reset log, channels, reconnection time, speed limit, precondition and pre/post action. If the database has encrypted tablespaces, you need to enter the correct wallet password in the **Encryption wallet password** option. You can disable synchronous I/O to speed up the restore job.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-29.png)

5. After confirming the restore information, click **Submit** and wait for the execution.

### Create Database Restore Jobs

When a logical error or disaster occurs in Oracle databases, you can restore the databases to a specified point-in-time state through timepoint restore jobs. Database timepoint restore supports restoring to the source or a different host. Before creating the restore job, start the target database instance but do not need to mount the database.

1. Select the Oracle database host and instance. Click **Next**.

2. Select **Databases** under the **Timepoint Restore** and set the restored database information. Specify the restore point in time by Restore to the latest time, Restore to point in time, Restore to SCN, Restore to backup state (shortest recovery time), and Analyze redo log files to find the exact SCN to restore to. Click **Next**.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-28.png)

3. Select the restore point in time by dragging the slider control or entering a specific point in time or SCN. For the restore content, you can select data files, control files, redo logs, and temporary files. PFILE/SPFILE, password files, Listener configuration, and TNSNames configuration. You can redirect the restored data via the **Modify the path of restore files** option.

4. Set **Restore Target**. You can restore to the source or a different host. Or you can restore to a database on a different host with the same operating system and Oracle version (major version number). Click **Next**. (It allows restoring to another instance with the same version on the source host. But the source instance should be shut down during the restore.)

5. Set **Restore Schedule**.

6. Set **Restore Options**.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-30.png)
![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-31.png)

The options include reset log, channels, reconnection time, speed limit, precondition, and pre/post action. You can set them according to your needs.  If the database has encrypted tablespaces, you need to enter the correct wallet password in the **Encryption wallet password** option. You can disable synchronous I/O to speed up the restore.

If you enable continuous log backups, you can set **Download buffer size** and **Reserve free disk space** when recovering continuous archive logs.

- Download buffer size: If the size of archive logs is greater than or equal to the value of this option, the log download will be stopped and then continue after the previously downloaded logs are applied and deleted.

- Reserve free disk space: If the free space of the disk (the target disk that save downloaded archive logs) is less than or equal to the value of this option, the log download will be stopped and then continue after the previously downloaded logs are applied and deleted.

> Note: If the parameters are not filled properly, the recovery of logs will be slowed down.

7. Confirm the job information is correct and submit the job.

### Create Tablespace Restore Jobs

Oracle tablespace timepoint restore can restore one or more non-SYSTEM tablespaces to a specified point in time without affecting other tablespaces. The Oracle 12c PDB timepoint restore can restore a PDB to a specified point in time without affecting other PDBs. Only databases in ARCHIVELOG mode and with Oracle 10.2.0.5 as well as later versions are supported for Tablespace Restore.

Limitations of tablespace timepoint restore:

- 11g R1 and earlier versions do not support restoring tablespaces that are deleted by DROP or restoring renamed tablespaces to a point in time before the rename operation.
- If the tables in the tablespace to be restored have constraints to other tables in other tablespaces, the related tablespaces must be restored together.
- A tablespace with SYS user objects cannot be restored.
- A tablespace with table replications cannot be restored.
- Snapshot logs and snapshot tables cannot be restored.
- VARRAY columns, nested tables, and external files cannot be restored.
- A tablespace with rollback segments cannot be restored.

> Note: Since different versions of Oracle have different limitations on tablespace timepoint restore, please read the official Oracle documentation in detail.

1. Click **Restore** and select the source host and Oracle instance. Select **Tablespace** as the restore type.
![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-32.png)

2. Select **Restore Target**. You can only choose the source host and instance as the restore target.

3. Set **Restore Schedule** to set the execution time of the job.

4. Set **Restore Options**. Enter **Auxiliary destination**. It stores the temporary files required for auxiliary instances. Please ensure that its space is larger than the size of the tablespace or PDB to be restored and the Oracle database user has the read and write permissions. If the database contains encrypted tablespaces, you also need to enter the correct wallet password in the **Encryption wallet password** option.

   ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-33.png)

5. Submit the restore job and wait for the completion.

### Create Table-Level Restore Jobs

Oracle table-level restore supports exporting a user's single table to a point-in-time state. Oracle 10.2.0.5 and later versions are supported.

> Note: Since table-level restore is performed on the source host, ADPS should connect to the source database. Please ensure that the database starts the listener, and the agent can be connected to the database with a net service name. You can use the tnsping or sqlplus command to confirm whether the database can be connected.

1. Go to **Restore** and select the Oracle database host and instance. Select **Table** under **Timepoint Restore** as the restore type. Click **Next**.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-34.png)

2. Select **Restore Schedule** to set the execution time of the job.

3. Set **Restore Options** including common and advanced options.

You can set common options including channels, auxiliary directory, and data cache directory. **Auxiliary directory** stores the temporary files required for auxiliary instances. Please ensure that its space is larger than the size of the tablespace or PDB to be restored and the Oracle database user has the read and write permissions. **Data cache directory** stores the export files of tables. If the database contains encrypted tablespaces, you also need to enter the correct wallet password in the **Encryption wallet password** option.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-35.png)

You can set advanced options including reconnection time, speed limit, precondition and pre/post action.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-36.png)

4. Set **Job Name** and check whether the job information is correct. Click **Submit**.

### Create Logical Import Jobs

1. Click **Restore** on the left-side menu and select the host and Oracle resource. Select **Data Pump Import** or **Traditional Import** as the restore type. If you have not performed **Data Pump Export** or **Traditional Export**, you cannot select the corresponding import.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-37.png)

- Select a point in time under the database list. The whole database will be imported.
- Select a point in time under the tablespace list. A tablespace will be imported.
- Select a point in time of a certain user under the user list. A schema will be imported. Multi-user import is supported.

2. Select **Restore Target**. We recommend restoring to a target with the same version as the source database. Limitations may exist among different versions and the import may fail.

3. Set **Restore Schedule**.

4. Set **Restore Options**. Select a user, enter the password, and set the data cache directory. You can set reconnection time, speed limit, precondition, and pre/post action according to your needs.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-38.png)

5. Confirm the job information, click **Submit** and wait for the job completion.

### Create Restore Archived Logs Jobs

This restore type is only applicable to the ARCHIVELOG mode. It can restore the archived logs and online logs in a specified range to the archived log directory under the database on the source or a different host. It there is no archived log directory, the logs will be restored to the db_recovery_file_dest directory. You can select the points in time of continuous backups and log backups. All archived logs must be backed up in the same storage pool.

1. Select the Oracle database host and instance. Select **Restore Archived Logs** and click **Next**.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-39.png)

2. Set **Restore Target**. You can restore to the source database or a database on a different host with the same operating system and Oracle version (major version number).  The target database should be at least in the MOUNTED state.

3. Set **Restore Schedule**. Immediate and one-time schedules are supported. Click **Next**.

4. Set **Restore Options** including channels, archived logs destination, reconnection time, speed limit, precondition, and pre/post action. You can set them according to your needs. Click **Next**.

5. Confirm the job information and click **Submit**.

### Create Recovery Testing Jobs

Oracle Recovery Testing can be used to create periodic restore jobs. It can restore the Oracle backup sets to a specified target host to verify the availability of the backup sets.

1. Select the Oracle database host and instance. Click **Next**.

2. Select **Recovery Testing** as the restore type. You do not need to select the point in time of backup sets. The job will recover the latest backup sets of the source host.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-40.png)

3. Select **Restore Target**. The target cannot be the source instance. The database version should be the same as the source database version.

4. Set **Restore Schedule**. It supports hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedule types. Click **Next**.

5. Set **Restore Options** including channels and reset log. If you do not enable the **Open database with "resetlogs" after restore** option, then in the next run, the data file will not be restored, while the archived logs will be used to restore the database to the latest backup state.

6. Confirm the job information and click **Submit**.

7. Wait for the periodic execution. The job will recover the latest backup sets of the source host.

### Create Logical Recovery Testing Jobs

Oracle Logical Recovery Testing can be used to create periodic logical import jobs. It can logically import the Oracle backup sets to a specified target host to verify the availability of backup sets.

1. Select the Oracle database host and instance. Click **Next**.

2. Select **Data Pump Recovery Testing** or **Traditional Recovery Testing**. The job will recover the latest backup sets of the source host.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-41.png)

3. Select **Restore Target**. We recommend restoring to a target with the same version as the source database. Limitations may exist between different versions and the import may fail.

4. Set **Restore Schedule**. It supports hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedule types. Click **Next**.

5. Set **Restore Options**. Select the user, enter the password, and set the data cache directory. You can also set the reconnection time, speed limit, precondition, and pre/post action according to your needs.

6. Confirm the job information and Click **Submit**.

7. Wait for the periodic execution. The job will recover the latest backup sets of the source host.

### Create Instant Recovery Jobs

Only databases with complete Oracle synthetic backups are supported for Instant Recovery. This restore type can reduce the recovery time by mounting the synthetic backup set at the corresponding point in time in the database synthetic pool.

1. Select the Oracle database host and instance. Click **Next**.

2. Select **Instant Recovery**. It supports restoring to a specified point in time, SCN, and the backup state (shortest recovery time).

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-42.png)

To restore the control files and log files to different directories on the source database, you can click **Modify the path of restore files** and edit the path of each file. However, when creating Instant Recovery, you cannot modify the path of data files, but can modify the path of other files.

3. Select **Restore Target**. It supports restoring to the source database and a database on a different host with the same operating system and Oracle version. The target database should be at least in the STARTED state.

4. Set **Restore Schedule**. You can set the execution time of the job.

5. Set **Restore Options** including common and advanced options.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-43.png)

In the common options, you can set channels, reset log, and archived logs destination.

About **Archived logs destination**:

- **Separate volume**: A separate volume in the storage pool to store archived logs. The volume will be deleted after the mounted data is detached.
- **Same volume as database copy**: Shared volume for backup set snapshots, i.e. same volume as backup set.
- **Local directory**: Local file system directory. It can list the space usage of the directory and help you to determine the required space of archived logs.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-44.png)

Advanced options include precondition, pre/post action, and storage protocol. In the **Storage protocol** option, you can create a new FC Target or iSCSI Target for the restore job. It supports restoring the backup sets from the iSCSI database synthetic pool to the FC and vice versa. This option requires the operator has the admin permissions. You can enable the **Disable synchronous I/O** option to speed up the recovery.

6. Confirm the job information and click **Submit**.

7. After the instant recovery job is completed. you can find a corresponding record on the **CDM**  interface. To delete the instance, you can click the **Delete** icon. The agent will shut down the instance and delete the mounted data files.

### Create Oracle Live Recovery Jobs

Oracle Live Recovery is designed to migrate the mounted database back to the source database smoothly after the source database undergoes emergency instant recovery due to crash or other reasons.

You can create Oracle Live Recovery jobs in two ways:

- Click **Restore** on the left-side menu, select the host and Oracle instance where the mounted database resides.
- Go to **CDM** and find the instant recovery job record. Click the + icon beside the record to start Live Recovery.

1. Select the Oracle database host and instance. Click **Next**.

2. Select **Live Recovery** as the restore type. The default restore destination is the original file path of the synthetic backup host. To restore the control files and log files to different directories, you can click **Modify the path of restore files** and edit the path of each file.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle_live_recovery-01.png)

3. Select **Restore Target**. It supports restoring to the source database and a database in a different host with the same operating system and Oracle version. The target database should be at least in the STARTED state.

4. Set **Restore Schedule**. You can set the execution time of the job.

5. Set **Restore Options** including common and advanced options.

Common options: Switch instance, host address of the mounted instance, target host address, and delete synced logs of the mounted instance.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle_live_recovery-02.png)

**Switch instance**:

- **Manual**: After the recovery, you should switch the instances manually.
- **Immediate**: After the recovery, ADPS will switch the instances immediately.
- **Specify time**: When the specified time is reached, ADPS will shut down the source instance and open the target instance.
- **Delay**: After the recovery, ADPS will switch the instances after the set time.

**Sync period**: Set the periodic time for archived log synchronization before switching instances.

**Archived logs cache directory for the target host**: Specify the cache directory for downloading archived logs.

Advanced options include reconnection time, resumption buffer size, speed limit, precondition, and pre/post action. You can enable the **Disable synchronous I/O** option to speed up the recovery speed.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle_live_recovery-03.png)

6. Confirm the job information and click **Submit**.

> Note: If the **Add job approval** option is enabled, the job should be approved by the admin before the execution.

## Manage Jobs

On the **Job** interface, you can view the backup and restore job information of all agents, start, modify, clone, and delete the jobs.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-45.png)

- Start: Click ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-46.png) to start the job immediately.
- Modify: Click ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-47.png) to modify the basic job information, backup/restore schedule, and backup/restore options.
- Delete: Click ![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-48.png) to access the confirmation window. Click **OK** to delete the job.

## Backup Protection Strategy

### Backup Schedule Operation

ADPS provides 6 types of backup schedules. The schedule type selected is only valid for the currently created job.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-53.png)

- Immediate: The job starts immediately after it is submitted.
- One Time: The job starts to run at a specified time. After the job is submitted, the job will be in an idle state and start to run when the specified run time is reached.
- Hourly: The job runs after a specified number of hours according to the setting. The value is an integer between 1 and 24.
- Daily: The job runs after a specified number of days according to the setting. The value is an integer between 1 and 5.
- Weekly: The job runs after a specified number of weeks according to the setting. You can specify which day of the week to run the job.
- Monthly: The job runs at the specified weeks/days of months.

> **Example: Run the job every two weeks on Friday at 18:00**

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-49.png)

> **The actual execution time is:**
>
> - If the current time is Friday 17:00, the execution time is Friday 18:00 (the current day).
> - If the current time is Thursday 17:00, the execution time is Friday 18:00 (the next day).
> - If the current time is Saturday 17:00, the execution time will be next Friday 18:00.
> - After the first run is completed, the job will start automatically at 18:00 on Friday every two weeks.

### Backup Strategy Advice

There are six Oracle backup types: full backup, incremental backup, cumulative incremental backup, logical backup, log backup, and synthetic backup. Full backup, incremental backup, cumulative incremental backup, and log backup can be used together. It is recommended to formulate the following backup strategy according to different situations such as network bandwidth, business data volume, security requirements, and the amount of lost data that you can tolerate.

1. When the application traffic is relatively small, run a **Full Backup** once a week to ensure that you have at least one recoverable RTO every week.
2. After that, you can run a **Incremental Backup** or **Cumulative Incremental Backup** every day to reduce the backup time and ensure that you have at least one recoverable RPO every day.
3. If the database supports log backup, you can run a **Log Backup** every few hours to ensure that the restore granularity RPO can reach the second level. For example, you can run a log backup every 2 hours.
4. You can use other backups according to application scenarios.

> Avoid using the strategies of all full backups or a full backup followed by cumulative incremental or log backups.

## Channel Number Configuration

- Description of the channel number for backup jobs. 1-255 channels are supported.

  When Oracle is backed up to a tape library pool, the channel number will be given a default value based on the number of drives in the tape library, the number of tapes, and whether the Oracle database is a RAC cluster. If the maximum number that can be filled is bigger than 4, the default value will be 4. Otherwise, the default value is the maximum number that can be filled.
  
  Restoring Oracle from a tape library pool only supports one channel and the number cannot be modified.

## Oracle Cluster

ADPS supports Oracle RAC, Oracle hot standby, Oracle Data Guard, Oracle Active Data Guard, Oracle XE, and Oracle One Node. Before the backup and restore, you should cluster the Oracle nodes.

> Note: Each node should be deployed according to the *Install and Configure Agent* as well as *Activate License and Assign Authorization*.

#### Cluster Binding

1. Go to **Resource** -> **Cluster**. Click the **Cluster Binding** icon.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-51.png)

2. Customize the cluster name. Select the active node as the **Primary Node**, the corresponding Oracle cluster type as the **Type**, and the inactive nodes as the **Nodes**. Click **Submit**.

![](../image/01-agent/oracle/oracle-52.png)

### Backup

#### Oracle XE

To create a backup job, go to the **Hosts and Resources** page and select the Oracle XE instance as the backup source. The remaining steps are similar to the single instance backup. However, Oracle XE does not support logical backups including Data Pump export and traditional export.

#### Oracle RAC

To create a backup job, go to the **Hosts and Resources** page where you can find all Oracle RAC nodes. Select the Oracle under any node as the backup source. The remaining steps are similar to single instance backup.

The Oracle RAC backup job will be performed on the active node. If the active node goes down, the remaining nodes will take over the backup job according to the node settings in cluster binding. After the downed node is normal, it will take over the backup job again.

#### Oracle One Node

To create a backup job, go to the **Hosts and Resources** page. Only the active node of Oracle One Node is displayed. Select the Oracle under the node as the backup source. The remaining steps are similar to single instance backup. However, please note that:

1. The Oracle One Node environment must be clustered. Please contact the admin to complete the *Cluster Binding* operation if necessary.
2. After the Oracle One Node switchover, the new active node will take over the backup job.

#### Oracle Hot Standby

To create a backup job, go to the **Hosts and Resources** page. Only the active node of Oracle Hot Standby is displayed. Select the Oracle under the node as the backup source. The remaining steps are similar to single instance backup. However, please note that:

1. The Oracle Hot Standby environment must be clustered. Please contact the admin to complete the *Cluster Binding* operation if necessary.
2. After the Oracle Hot Standby switchover, the new active node will take over the backup job.

#### Oracle Data Guard

To create a backup job, go to the **Hosts and Resources** page. Only the host of Oracle Data Guard is displayed. Select the Oracle primary database under the host as the backup source. The remaining steps are similar to single instance backup. However, please note that:

1. The backup of Oracle Data Guard primary database is supported. After the switchover between the primary and standby databases, the backup job will not be taken over by the new primary database automatically. You need to recreate a backup job.

#### Oracle Active Data Guard

To create a backup job, go to the **Hosts and Resources** page. Both the primary and standby databases can be backed up and restored. The remaining steps are similar to single instance backup. Please note that:

1. Continuous log backup of primary and standby databases is supported.

### Restore

#### Oracle XE

The **Restore Target** step displays the Oracle XE host and resource. Select the Oracle XE instance as the restore target. The remaining steps are similar to the single instance restore. However, Oracle XE does not support Logical Import including tablespace and table timepoint restore.

#### Oracle RAC

The **Restore Target** step displays all the nodes of Oracle RAC. Select the Oracle under any Oracle RAC node as the restore target. The remaining steps are similar to the single instance restore.

After the creation, the restore will be performed on the node selected as the restore target. Oracle instances of other nodes will be closed. After the single node restore is complete, Oracle instances of the other nodes will be started.

#### Oracle One Node

The **Restore Target** step displays the active node of Oracle One Node. Select the Oracle under the Oracle One Node active node as the restore object. The remaining steps are similar to the single instance restore.

#### Oracle Hot Standby

The **Restore Target** step displays the active node of Oracle Hot Standby. Select the Oracle under the Oracle Hot Standby active node as the restore object. The remaining steps are similar to the single instance restore. However, please note that:

1. The Oracle Hot Standby environment must be clustered. Please contact the admin to complete the *Cluster Binding* operation if necessary.
2. After the Oracle Hot Standby switchover, only the Oracle active node will be displayed on the **Hosts and Resources** page.

#### Oracle Data Guard

The **Restore Target** step displays the primary database of Oracle Data Guard. Select the Oracle under the primary database of Oracle Data Guard as the restore object. The remaining steps are similar to the single instance restore. However, please note that:

1. The restore of Oracle Data Guard primary database is supported. After the switchover between the primary and standby databases, you should install the backup agent on the new primary database, connect it to the backup server, and authorize the license so that the restore can be performed on it.

#### Oracle Active Data Guard

The **Restore Target** step displays the standby database of Oracle Active Data Guard. Select the Oracle under the standby database of Oracle Active Data Guard as the restore object. The remaining steps are similar to the single instance restore. However, please note that:

- Before the restore, you should close the log application on the standby database.
- If you enable the **Reset log** option, the standby database will become the primary after the restore.
- When the restore of the standby database is completed, you need to check the Oracle database alert log after opening the database. If alerts like "ORA-00338: log 5 of thread 1 is more recent than control file" are reported, you can execute "alter database clear unarchvied logfile group 5;".
